&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The Federal Reserve is planning to lend a total of $600 billion directly to middle-market businesses, businesses that are too large to fall under the Small Business Administration loan program but too small to benefit from the Federal Reserve’s larger loan programs. Through this program, businesses can receive a loan from a bank and sell up to 95% of their debt to the Federal Reserve. Points of concern with this program include the central bank venturing into new territory and a possibility of not enough businesses seeking aid. On Tuesday, Congress approved $500 billion to support financial aid from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. At the online congressional hearing earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin encouraged a wait-and-see approach regarding federal aid, whereas Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell urged for more aid. Federal Reserve officials plan to keep interest rates close to zero until inflation rates reach 2%. The Federal Reserve might also implement yield-curve control, which consists of buying Treasury securities to cap yields on short- and medium-term Treasurys. 
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	China has increased purchases of U.S. agricultural goods. Although the relation between China and the U.S. is at a low, U.S. companies are still actively trying to increase attraction in China. On Friday, China dismissed their GDP target after acknowledging the plateau of its economy. President Xi Jinping had no choice but to let go of a long-standing political goal, which was doubling the economy from a decade ago by the time of the Chinese Communist Party’s hundredth anniversary. Relations with China and the U.S. are starting to look rocky; the two leading world economies have begun to restrict business interactions in trade and technology. In the European Union, the composite Purchasing Managers Index rose from 13.6 in April to 30.5 in May. Although a reading below 50 indicates fall in activity, the index is slowly climbing back up.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    An additional 2.4 million unemployment claims were filed last week, bringing the total number over the past 9 weeks to more than 38 million unemployed. All 50 states will have made an effort to reopen as of May 20, 2020. During Covid-19’s initial economic impact, technology businesses such as Amazon and Microsoft were resilient against major changes in employment. However, smaller technology businesses such as Uber and Airbnb have begun to suffer from major layoffs. Economists consider unemployment to be the great cause of a long economic recovery period, saying that low demand leads to harsh job cuts, resulting in several years of economic recovery. Secretary Mnuchin, President Trump, and other administrative officials expect the U.S. to experience a V-shaped recovery.
