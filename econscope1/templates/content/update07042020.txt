&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The Federal Reserve cut interest rates in March 2020, expecting to maintain rates near zero through the year 2022. In order to eliminate weekly reductions, the Fed is going to keep their recent pace of investment in Treasury and mortgage securities. This monthly rate includes $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage bonds. Officials believe that smoothing market functioning is integral to stimulating the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve has taken notice of Australia’s use of yield caps and hopes to model federal actions from these tactics to keep interest rates low. When implementing yield caps, the Reserve Bank of Australia invests in government securities such that yields remain at certain levels. By holding government debt yields steady, private sector interest rates remain low, pre-pandemic employment levels are regained, and inflation can stay at a healthy rate, all at minimal damage to the federal budget. However, some are skeptical about whether the yield cap will have much impact when interest rates are already near zero. Furthermore, U.S. fixed-rate mortgages are funded mostly at the longer end, requiring longer-dated yields which is more difficult to implement. Overall, officials are still monitoring the effectiveness of this RBA policy and will weigh the costs and benefits before applying the policy to the U.S.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	With the Paycheck Protection Program application window closing on June 30, there is still $134 billion available as of June 29. Both political parties are in agreement that the remaining funds should go toward small business economic relief, yet have come to a crossroads on how to do so. One proposed solution was to allow certain businesses to apply for a second loan, specifically those that have less than 100 employees, have experienced a 50% decrease in revenue as a result of the pandemic, and have already invested in a previous PPP loan. In order to encourage borrowers, Congress has lengthened the loan period from 8 weeks to 24 weeks and has allowed for increased flexibility regarding loan use.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    The U.S. had a 4.8 million job increase, causing the unemployment rate to fall to 11.1% for the month of June. Around 40% of this jobless rate decrease is attributed to rehirings in the leisure and hospitality sectors. Although displaying a significant decrease from April’s jobless rate of 14.7%, there are still 15 million more unemployed than in February, before the pandemic struck. The U.S. is undergoing a more rapid recovery than expected, signified by the fall in unemployment as well as business reopenings after weeks of shutdown. Consumer spending patterns over the last few months have shown apprehensive yet increasing shopper activity. Travel spending on airlines, rental cars, Airbnbs, and hotels has plummeted during March and is slowly easing its way toward pre-pandemic levels. Grocery sales in the U.S. spiked in mid-March as civilians stock up during the crisis. Spending on food delivery services has increased up to 207.1%. Overall, online spending has risen up to 140.79% while in-store spending has fallen as much as 98%. Although bars have begun to reopen, data demonstrates that civilians are more willing to drink at home rather than at an open bar. Hair salon customer count plunged near the end of April, but experienced a spike in May as most states began the reopening process. Foot traffic in the U.S. fell sharply in March, but has steadily eased its way upward since April. Worried about a possible second wave in Covid-19 cases, officials continue to urge civilians to wear masks in public and conduct proper sanitization processes.
