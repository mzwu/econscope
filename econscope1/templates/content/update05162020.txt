&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The Federal Reserve is unlikely to enact negative interest rates, saying that the cost outweighs the foreseeable benefits. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that “The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly worse than any recession since World War II.” He also said that more fiscal support from Congress and the White House is necessary to avoid long-term economic damage and a long recovery period. On May 12, House Democrats proposed a $3 trillion economic relief measure which consists of $1 trillion aid toward state and local governments and the rest for $1200 individual stimulus.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Last week, 3 million more workers filed for unemployment benefits, bringing the total over the last two months to 36.5 million. Economists project GDP to decrease 6.6% this year and the unemployment rate to reach 17% in June. In the midst of vast unemployment, stocks keep climbing as S&P 500 reaches its highest point in the last 3 decades. However, the stock market is not an indicator of the current economic circumstance. Stock markets are forward-looking, meaning that investors are expecting an economic recovery soon. Consumer Price Index decreased 0.8% and gasoline prices fell 20.6%. The U.S. budget deficit rose to $1.935 trillion in the 12 months through April. Spending increased from $384 billion to $979.71 billion while revenue decreased 55% to $241.86 billion.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    In April, U.S. retail sales fell 16.4% and industrial production dropped 11.2%. Women constitute most of the service sector, and since the pandemic has greatly impacted service jobs, unemployment has taken a larger toll on women than men. Social distancing has led to declines in education, leisure, and hospitality professions. During the month of April, the female unemployment rate was 16.2%, compared to the male unemployment rate of 13.5%. Economic shock is largely being absorbed by low-income households, as almost 40% of households earning less than $40,000 a year lost at least one job in March, causing them to be unable to cover monthly expenses.
