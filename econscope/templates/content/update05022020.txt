&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Many changes regarding loans occurred this past week. Firstly, the Small Business Administration webpage for processing loans crashed, resulting in a considerable amount of concern. The Federal Reserve decided to stretch the boundaries of central bank actions by lending directly to large and small businesses, cities, and states. The Federal Reserve expanded its lending program through the Main Street Lending Program, which helps both large and small businesses. Prior to this week, large businesses have been blamed for taking funds that were supposedly intended for smaller businesses, prompting Treasury Secretary Mnuchinâ€™s request for an apology. In order to provide aid to a greater number of businesses throughout the U.S., the eligibility requirements for business loans have been loosened. The maximum number of employees has risen to 15,000, maximum annual revenue has increased to $5 billion, and the minimum loan size has shrunk to $500,000. Mnuchin also wants private schools with large endowments to return funds in order to direct them to small businesses. In international news, the Bank of Japan has increased its maximum holdings of corporate debt in order to support small businesses.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	This past week, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S. surpassed 1 million. In the past 6 weeks, 30 million U.S. unemployment claims have been filed. Oil prices decreased 27% to around $12 a barrel for the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude. Trump signed the Defense Production Act to keep meat-processing plants running during this pandemic. Personal consumption decreased by 7.6%, goods spending decreased by 1.3%, and business spending fell by 8.6%. According to the Institute of Supply Management, the manufacturing index dropped from 49.1% to 41.5%, a low in the past decade. Overall, GDP shrank at an annual rate of 4.8% in the first quarter of 2020, marking the largest drop in quarterly economic output since the fourth quarter of 2008. Graduating high school seniors are unsure of whether to attend top-tier colleges, at least until they know if campuses will open in the fall. This could possibly indicate revenue drops for universities as well.
