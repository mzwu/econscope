&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	88.1 million eligible individuals have received their stimulus payments from the IRS. These paper checks were said to arrive on April 24. In order to be considered eligible, an individual must make at most $75,000 annually. The payments consist of up to $1,200 plus an additional $500 per child. Out of the $2 trillion federal stimulus package, $250 billion was allocated toward personal stimulus checks. The individuals who have already received their checks constitute around half of all those who are eligible. These payments will not be considered income, and therefore will not be taxable as a part of income tax. There have been issues with payment reception including delays and incorrect amounts, but the IRS is currently working to tackle those problems.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Alaska, Oklahoma, Georgia, and South Carolina have already begun a partial reopening. In these states, nonessential businesses such as salons, gyms, and restaurants have started up business again. However, safety measures are being enforced, such as limited capacity and reservations only (no walk-ins). Fourteen other states are planning to reopen activity by April 30. Residents are highly advised to remain socially distant from each other, but citizens will be allowed to return to work and reopen businesses. The remaining U.S. states are under strict lockdown. The projected date of reopening is not in clear sight, so stay-at-home orders will remain enforced. According to Janet Yellen, former Chair of the Federal Reserve, the optimal plan of action for the economy is to reopen as soon as possible, but health concerns limit the extent to which it is safe to reopen.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The Federal Reserve has permitted banks to allow consumers to make unlimited withdrawals from bank accounts, instead of the previous monthly limit of six withdrawals. This action was justified by the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic has made access to cash “more urgent.” As of the current economic conditions, the federal budget deficit will reach 18% of the national GDP by the end of the fiscal year. Moreover, unemployment rates are expected to average at 14%. In general, economists anticipate for the economy to decline 12% in the second quarter alone.
