&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The Republican proposal for the next COVID-19 economic relief bill includes a second round of $1200 individual stimulus payments, $100 billion toward schools and universities, and additional aid for COVID-19 testing, totaling up to $1 trillion. On the other hand, Democrats prefer to allocate $1 trillion toward state and local government budget gaps. Moreover, Democrats want to extend the $600 weekly unemployment benefits until January 2021, whereas Republicans view these benefits as discouragement for people to return to work. Further discussion on this next stimulus package incites concern, as the Federal Reserve can only do so much for the economy. After cutting interest rates near zero and pouring trillions to stimulate the economy, Federal Reserve officials are near the edge of their capabilities. Some drawbacks of the Federal Reserve’s power include the inability to revive the aviation industry, repair supply chains, and make people feel comfortable going outside to purchase at shopping malls. Other than spending more to buy Treasurys and mortgage bonds, there is not more that the Federal Reserve can do. The Fed already plans to keep interest rates near zero for years. The key to restoring the U.S. economy as it once was before is finding and administering a vaccine for the virus.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The Federal Reserve launched nine emergency lending programs when COVID-19 first hit the U.S. in March: the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, Commercial Paper Funding Facility, Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, Corporate Credit Facilities, Municipal Liquidity Facility, Main Street Lending Program and Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. On July 28, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, along with five other Federal Reserve board members, agreed to extend the operations of these lending programs until at least December 31. The Federal Reserve stated that these extensions would “facilitate planning by potential facility participants and provide certainty that the facilities will continue to be available to help the economy recover.”
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     Consumer spending rose 5.6% in June following an 8.5% increase in May, signaling greater spending on medical care, restaurant meals, travel, and clothing. However, recent data suggests that COVID-19 cases are rising once again and could deter the nation’s goal of a V-shaped GDP recovery. Nevertheless, economists are still hopeful for an economic rebound in the third quarter of 2020. This rebound depends on a number of factors: whether the U.S. can keep the virus under control, whether Congress will supply extra stimulus funding, and whether U.S. citizens feel comfortable to emerge from self-isolation.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     The eurozone’s GDP dropped at an annual rate of 40.3%, much greater than the 32.9% decline experienced by the U.S. Europe’s economy contracted 12.1% more in the second quarter than in the first quarter of 2020. Tourism, industrial production, and retail sales are a few of the most harmed sectors in the European Union. Although Europe has restrained the virus to a greater extent than the U.S., the eurozone has experienced a greater economic contraction, largely due to the U.S.’s ease in lifting restrictions and providing heavy amounts of federal economic stimulus. In China, July marks the fifth month in a row that the nation’s manufacturing activity has increased. China reported a purchasing managers index (PMI) of 51.1 in July, indicating an increase from a PMI of 50.9 in June. China’s supply side has returned to pre-pandemic levels, yet consumer demand remains at weaker levels. China’s lawmakers have stated that they will no longer extend stimulus measures, and they are encouraging domestic and export economies to support each other.
