&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	At the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, civilians swarmed stores for hand sanitizer, soap, and face masks. But another aisle was surprisingly empty: toilet paper. Not only did citizens stock up on sanitary necessities, but it seemed as if everyone needed to hide out in their homes for months -- and they were right. Toilet paper, paper towels, water cases, canned food, and more now-precious commodities have been sold out at numerous locations. One product that has been thriving particularly well since the Covid-19 pandemic is orange juice. Orange juice futures have increased by 19%. Researchers speculate that the success of orange juice during this period of time is due to its rich vitamin C content, the boost it offers to oneâ€™s immune system, and the need for consumers to stay home and self isolate. Car sales have also been greatly impacted; Chinese car sales have fallen by 86% in February alone, BMW sales decreased 20% between January and March 2020, and Britain lost 44% of its new car registrations. Over the month of March, retail and food sales have dropped by 8.7%.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	On the global market, there has been a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia regarding crude oil. After a feud between the two countries, the price of crude oil greatly decreased in early March, hitting an 18-year low. Additionally, as a result from the coronavirus, the slowing of economic activity reduced energy prices. The consumer energy price index decreased 5.8% in March. The U.S. became involved in a pact with Saudi Arabia and Russia to limit the amount of oil production that gets released into the market. A decrease in demand of oil over the period of state lockdowns combined with the reduction of oil prices led the top oil suppliers, as rational producers, to withhold a portion of daily oil output. By doing so, the decreased oil demand is met with decreased supply. These actions will relieve the pressure on oil prices when the global economy returns to normalcy.
