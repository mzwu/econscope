&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The U.S. service sector experienced a major fallback due to the novel coronavirus pandemic and subsequent state closures. However, these industries displayed improvement during the month of June as prices and exports increased, signaling stimulated demand. Although it seems as if the U.S. is on track for economic recovery, a second wave in Covid-19 cases could stall the recovery. Texas and Florida have already placed new restrictions as officials saw the number of infections creep upward. Latinx workers comprise a large portion of service sector jobs, causing the Latinx unemployment rate to reach 14.5% in June as compared to 10.1% for whites. As the coronavirus-induced recession deepens, many states have been forced to cut spending, specifically taking a toll on schools and universities. Students and parents are concerned about the effectiveness of health measures and the quality of education under these circumstances. Of the 1.5 million government jobs cut, most are in the education field. A $1 trillion package was passed in May to support state and local governments, but states continue to deal with extremely high levels of uncertainty.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	The number of U.S. layoffs and discharges in May fell to pre-pandemic levels at around 1.8 million, a drastic change from 11.5 million in March and 7.7 million in April. In addition, the number of rehirings increased to 6.5 million in May from 4 million in April. While these statistics are forward-looking, the rise in COVID-19 cases over the recent weeks could potentially cause tighter social restrictions, state closures, and a decline in economic recovery. In the week ending in July 4th, 1.3 million new unemployment claims were filed, the lowest amount of initial weekly claims since March 21st. However, this measure is still significantly higher than pre-pandemic statistics which have steadily averaged around 0.2 million. Through March and April, 21 million jobs were lost, while 7.5 million jobs were regained in May and June. As of June 2020 the millions who are currently unemployed significantly exceed the amount of job availability, with 17.75 million unemployed and only 5.4 million job openings. Economists expect the employment rate to grow over time at a slow rate. The recent rise in COVID-19 cases is concerning news regarding employment, as state governors are pressured to declare lockdowns once again.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is working with the Trump administration and the Senate to pass a bill for additional financial aid by the end of July. As unemployment benefits near expiration, officials want to continue benefits especially targeted towards workers in industries that are unlikely to recover soon. Mnuchin also aims to place a maximum benefit amount of the workerâ€™s income prior to the pandemic. Officials are also considering a second round of direct individual stimulus payments, as well as an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program focused on helping smaller businesses and businesses in dire need of aid.
