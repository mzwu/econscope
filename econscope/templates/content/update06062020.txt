&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	Violent protests instigated by the death of George Floyd have caused significant damage to retailer and restaurant property. Business locations across the country have closed to recover from looting. Businesses that were hoping to reopen after the harm caused by the coronavirus pandemic are set back even further, suffering from the effects of both disasters. Over the past decade, the job gap between whites and blacks has narrowed, but the income gap remains significant. African Americans were more susceptible to fall ill to the coronavirus, and less-equipped African American children did not have the means to continue schooling after school shutdowns. Especially because of the Covid-19 pandemic and recent protests, African Americans are at risk for further economic downfalls. 
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	China reached a Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) of 50.7 in May, displaying increasing factory activity. However, other areas such as the U.S., Asia, and Europe still yield PMI levels below 50 due to decreasing factory activity. Although trends show a positive projection, the road to economic recovery seems to be long and turbulent. A culmination of factors, including restricted movement and weak demand, contribute to low activity rates. Last week, China imposed new national security laws on Hong Kong. President Trump stated that he would regard Hong Kong as the same body as China, threatening to implement export controls, tariffs and visa restrictions. Because of this, U.S. businesses with offices in Hong Kong could face disruptions to their activity. An increasing number of Chinese factories have begun to reopen and ease pandemic-related restrictions. However, the sluggish demand marked by a decrease in China’s PMI measure threatens the factories’ activity. Surveys show that China’s economic recovery is slow due to lack of oversea demand.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    U.S. states are experiencing unemployment-benefit fraud that largely springs from identity theft. According to the Secret Service, at least hundreds have supported the money laundering scheme, targeting local and national banks and credit unions. Some states do not require evidence of wages to file for benefits, possibly losing millions of taxpayer money. Last week, there were 1.9 million unemployment claims, the first time the number fell below 2 million in almost 3 months. Although the number of new claims per week is steadily decreasing, the total number of jobless claims reached a record of 21.5 million. Reports show that May unemployment had the most drastic effects on larger companies with at least 1000 employees, especially in the trade and transportation sectors. Even though economists surveyed by FactSet expected the May unemployment rate to reach 19.8%, in actuality the job reports displayed that the U.S. jobless rate fell to 13.3% from 14.7% in April. These numbers from mid-May surveys suggest that jobs are returning; however, more recent data could indicate a setback from riots and looting instigated by the death of George Floyd.
