        <p class="lead"> According to the World Bank, the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 could lead to a “lost decade” in the 2020s.  </p>

          <p>Previously, the World Bank already expected slower economic growth throughout the decade following 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic only served to weaken expectations. Prior to the onset of the pandemic, the World Bank predicted a 2.1% annual growth from 2020 to 2029, down from 2.5% from 2010 to 2019. However, the World Bank has adjusted their forecasts for the current decade down to 1.9%. Despite this, the organization expects that developing countries will expand at a 3.3% yearly rate from 2020 to 2029. The World Bank projects that the global economy will grow 4% in 2021 after a 4.3% global contraction in 2020. Within this prediction, the U.S. is forecasted to grow 3.5%, the eurozone is expected to expand 3.6%, and China is predicted to grow 7.9% in 2021.</p>

        <p>The global manufacturing sector increased output toward the end of 2020, by contrast to the falling activity in the service sector that requires physical proximity. Economists expect this disparity to continue into 2021 until vaccines progress into stages that allow it to be distributed across the masses. The purchasing managers indexes for manufacturing indicates rising activity for an index above 50 and falling activity for an index below 50. Germany’s PMI increased in December 2020 to 58.3, China’s PMI fell slightly to 53, and Japan’s PMI rose to 50 after 19 months of below-50 readings. Although countries have placed tighter restrictions due to rising COVID-19 cases, factories around the world are reporting recovery through higher levels of output. However, manufacturing employers may continue to cut payrolls despite increasing signs of recovery, showing that factories are still bearing the long lasting costs of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <p>The U.S.’s purchasing-managers indexes for services dropped to 54.8 in the last month of 2020, marking the slowest growth in the service sector in three months. Growing COVID-19 cases in the late winter months have suppressed service activity, as shown by the U.S.’s growth slowdown. Despite this setback, economists still expect that the U.S. economy grew in the last quarter of 2020, although it is very likely that the expansion rate was lower than the previous quarter. On the other hand, the eurozone’s purchasing-managers indexes for services rose from 41.7 in November to 46.4 in December. Although the index increased, the latest figure is still below the benchmark of 50, which signals that the eurozone is undergoing economic contraction in the service sector. Likewise, the European Central Bank estimates that the eurozone economy shrank 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Since this marks the second quarter in a row of decreasing output, economists fear that the eurozone could fall into a recession.</p>

        <p>The U.S. trade deficit, calculated by the gap between imports and exports, reached a high in the past 14 years in November of 2020. According to the Commerce Department, the trade gap widened 8% from October to November, reaching a seasonally adjusted $68.14 billion, which is the highest trade deficit seen since August 2006. In November, imports rose by 2.9% while exports only rose 1.2%. Of the increased demand in imports, consumer good imports rose the most. Additionally, industrial supplies and capital goods imports also rose. Typical deficits for the U.S. exist in goods, whereas surplus is usually present in services. In November, the services surplus fell to its lowest level since August 2012 in response to increased precautions and restrictions put in place as a result of surging COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, since trade deficits subtracts from gross domestic product, GDP is likely to display growth drags for the final quarter of 2020.</p>

        <p>After seven months in a row of job growth in the U.S., the Labor Department reported that 140,000 jobs were lost in December of 2020. This job loss had the greatest impact in the restaurant and bar industry, while leisure and hospitality also experienced some job loss. Additionally, schools and governments also saw job losses as tighter restrictions are being put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike previous months, job gains in other sectors were not high enough to compensate for these drastic job losses. The U.S. unemployment rate remained at 6.7%, which is significantly lower than the pandemic height of 14.8% in April but still twice as much as the pre-pandemic unemployment rate. Economists believe that this unemployment spell is temporary, and that distribution of vaccines will spur rehiring in multiple sectors. As of December 2020, 12 million of the 22 million total jobs lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been recovered. However, this means that the current economy still has nearly 10 million jobs less than prior to the pandemic.</p>
