        <p class="lead"> The year 2021 could hold substantial job growth for the U.S. economy, although it is unlikely that all 22 million jobs lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic will be recovered.  </p>

         <p>According to the data firm IHS Markit, U.S. nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase 6.7 million by the end of December 2021. Less optimistically, economic forecasting firm Oxford Economics predicts that 5.8 million jobs will be regained, and University of Michigan economists predict a total job growth of 5.3 million. Regardless, these gains will be able to partially offset the 9.4 million net job loss experienced in 2020. Economists from various firms predict an average unemployment rate of roughly 5.3% at the end of 2021. All of these figures approximately forecast greater job growth in 2021 when compared to the 4.3 million jobs created in 1946 after World War II. However, although modern forecasts are nominally greater than post-World War II, this year’s growth will turn out to be about 5%, whereas 1946 saw a 11% increase. Additionally, economists expect that the economy will rebound faster from the COVID-19 induced recession than the past two recessions in US history. </p>

          <p>At the end of 2020, consumer prices in the U.S. increased. The consumer price index, which measures the price of everyday items that U.S. consumers purchase on average, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.4% from November to December of 2020. The Labor Department reported that 60% of this increase in the overall price level came from the 8.4% increase in gasoline prices. Core prices, which include most prices except food and energy, rose 0.1% in December, which was consistent with economists’ predictions. Grocery prices rose 0.4% in December, and apparel prices experienced a strong growth as well. Service prices rose 0.1% overall during December, but medical care and transportation prices fell. Currently, economists expect for recovery rates to ramp up in the second half of 2021, offsetting the slow economic growth the U.S. has experienced in the recent fall and winter months.</p>

          <p>In December of 2020, U.S. retail sales dropped 0.7% from $546.5 billion in November to $545.96 billion in December. According to the Commerce Department, December marks the third month in a row of declining U.S. retail sales, which measures spending at stores, restaurants, and online. Specifically, spending decreased in online purchases, restaurants, electronics, department stores, and groceries. December’s spending increased on home improvement, health care, apparel, and gasoline, but spending in these categories were not enough to offset the recent decreasing trend in retail sales. Although December typically yields high retail sale volume due to the holiday season, figures from 2020 were affected by rising COVID-19 cases and increased restrictions. Economists expect for economic activity to remain sluggish in the next few months until vaccination becomes effective across the nation and restrictions are lifted.</p>

          <p>U.S. online job postings at the end of 2020 were 10.6% lower than a year earlier. December’s job postings actually increased from November, reflecting the trend of reopening businesses after the turbulent spring and summer seasons. However, job growth has slowed since the summer of 2020, so the job market hasn’t seen significant improvements in the fall and winter months. Economists at Indeed believe that although January is typically a month for strong job openings, January 2021 might go against the normal trends. Employers at restaurants, hair salons, and other service businesses requiring face-to-face work are experiencing weaker demand and tighter restrictions.Additionally, the Labor Department reported that layoffs in November increased to 2 million from 1.7 million a month prior. Layoffs were concentrated in the service sector, state and local governments, and healthcare companies. Despite the lack of improvement in the labor market, COVID-19 vaccine distribution is starting up and leading economists to a more positive outlook for the future.</p>

          <p>In the week that ended on January 9, 2021, unemployment claims jumped to 0.965 million, marking the highest figure in nearly five months. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell even remarked that the U.S. economy is “a long way from maximum employment.” This rise in unemployment claims serves as a reminder that the U.S. is still suffering from high COVID-19 infection rates and long-term economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Another cause of concern comes from the increase in the amount of people receiving benefits from regular state benefit programs. The week of December 26, 2020, saw the first increase in those receiving regular state benefits after many months of decreasing trends. However, some individuals are exhausted benefits altogether as they are experiencing long-term unemployment.</p>
