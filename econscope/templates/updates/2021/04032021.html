        <p class="lead"> President Biden plans for his next big government spending to be rolled out in two programs, one that is focused on infrastructure and the other that is focused on child care and health care.    </p>

          <p>The infrastructure proposal, which includes green energy programs, will be laid out soon, while the child care and health care proposal is set to be released in April 2021. To help finance these programs, the administration plans to increase taxes on high-income households and businesses. Opinions on these new plans vary by party affiliation. Democrats believe that these programs will benefit household incomes and economic growth, whereas Republicans consider this wasteful spending and are against raising taxes. Some officials are worried that the government is accruing too much debt from government stimulus, but others believe that low interest and inflation rates provide ample room for government involvement in fostering economic growth for the nation. The two-part plan is expected to cost $3 trillion, which marks 1% of U.S. GDP and a 5% increase in federal spending.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is reviving the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of regulators that monitor the stability of the U.S. financial system. They will focus on the risks that emerged last year when the COVID-19 pandemic shook the U.S. economy. According to the Treasury Department, the council will also discuss the activities and roles of money-market mutual funds and hedge funds. In March 2020, investors jumped to liquidize their assets, leading to increased volatility in short-term funding markets. After the Federal Reserve cut interest rates near zero and implemented numerous emergency lending programs, markets stabilized and the financial system was kept intact. The council’s purpose is to discuss different matters regarding the financial system, but they could decide that regulatory action is needed and call upon further action. The FSOC was heavily involved in the Obama administration during the 2008-9 recession, but was less present during Trump’s administration. Now, Ms. Yellen is bringing the council back to evaluate possible restrictions of risky activity.</p>

          <p>The Labor Department reported that 719,000 unemployment claims were filed in the week that ended on March 27. This was an increase from the previous week’s figure of 658,000 jobless claims, but remained near the pandemic’s record low point. Furthermore, the four-week moving average for unemployment claims dropped to 719,000, which marks the lowest measure since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Although almost triple the four-week moving average prior to the pandemic, the most recent figure marks significant improvement from the height of the pandemic. Improving labor market conditions, in conjunction with eased restrictions on business activity and greater consumer spending, have led economists to adopt positive outlooks on the U.S. economy. Although the U.S. economy is making great strides toward recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is still a long path ahead to achieve full recovery.</p>

          <p>According to the Labor Department, 916,000 jobs were added by employers in March 2021. The unemployment rate also fell to 6% in March. These two changes in the labor market signal both increased hiring and additional entries into the labor force. After setbacks by the winter storms, the labor market is back on its road to recovery, which is a significant factor in the overall health of the U.S. economy. Many industries experienced greater hiring, but a large portion of added jobs belonged to the restaurant and hotel sector. Construction, manufacturing and the government also experienced strong improvements in hiring. According to economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal, 514,000 jobs will be added each month for at least the next year, contributing to an overall increase of 6 million jobs. This would make up for a substantial portion of current employment, but still leave the U.S. at greater unemployment than prior to the pandemic.</p>
