        <p class="lead"> Over the past year, the U.S. federal government has incurred great debts to handle and recover from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including mass layoffs and business closures.   </p>

          <p>According to the Congressional Budget Office, U.S. national debt is expected to rise to 202% by the year 2051, an alarming rate that encompasses spending on healthcare and debt service. In comparison to the 3.1% yearly economic growth rate from the years 1951 to 2020, the U.S. economy is forecasted to grow by 1.8% annually for the next 30 years. This projection does not consider the $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package that is proposed by the Biden administration. This package is supported by Democrats who believe that the stimulus is necessary for the recovery of businesses and households that were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, Republicans view the package as a concerning cause for rising U.S. debt.</p>

          <p>In response to the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom became the first large economy to establish higher taxes to help its economy recover from the worst recession it has experienced in the past three centuries. To cover the costs incurred by the central government, the U.K. plans to raise taxes in 2023, making it the first major economy to create and follow through with a plan to cover the huge government programs created to help households and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, vaccine distribution has spread somewhat quickly in the U.K.; currently, one-third of the U.K. population is vaccinated, compared to one-fifth of the U.S. population. In the entire European Union, 7.5% of its population has received a COVID-19 vaccine. U.K. Treasury chief Rishi Sunak plans to continue worker and business support into September of 2021, but has emphasized the need to think about financing the U.K.’s government debts.</p>

          <p>According to the Labor Department, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index for February is expected to demonstrate strong growth for the U.S.’s factories. This monthly survey encapsulates changes in demand for goods, consumer and producer outlook, supply chains’ states, and delivery times. The Institute’s service index for February is projected to display service sector growth for the ninth month in a row, which means that the service sector is experiencing a steady rebound from the downturn of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier last year. Unemployment claims in the U.S. in the week that ended on February 27 are expected to remain steady, since the labor market still has a long road to full recovery. U.S. employers are expected to have added jobs to the labor market in February, but not enough to boost the labor market’s recovery. These indices and other economic measures could possibly be affected by the winter storms and power outages experienced in the south, which could set back the measured growth of the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Current inflation rates are well below the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%. Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the inflation rate fell from 2.3% in February 2020 to 1.4% in January 2021, which marks the lowest inflation rate since 2011. With an absence of boosted labor markets and public expectations of rising price levels, inflation does not seem to rise significantly for the foreseeable future. However, people are beginning to worry that long-term inflation will rise to unhealthy levels. With the provision of large federal stimulus bills, economists believe that inflation could rise well above 2% in the long-term. They say that the Federal Reserve’s goal to overshoot 2% inflation could lead to a lessened priority on keeping inflation in check. Historically, handling the balance between unemployment and inflation proved to be a severe issue in the U.S. economy, but the Federal Reserve and Biden administration are confident that today’s officials have learned from the past and are equipped to make adequate policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Employers added 379,000 jobs to the U.S. economy in February of 2021, causing the unemployment rate to fall from 6.3% in January to 6.2% in February. This marks the largest monthly net change in jobs since October of 2020. The recently reported unemployment rate is substantially lower than the COVID-19 peak of 14.8% in April 2020, but is still higher than pre-pandemic levels. Overall, the number of payrolls in February 2021 was 6.21% less than the amount a year prior. Most of the job gains belonged to the leisure and hospitality sector, with a small number of added jobs in temporary help services, manufacturing, and healthcare industries. The jobs gains reflect easing business restrictions, more widespread COVID-19 vaccine distribution, and greater consumer spending that allows businesses and industries to thrive. </p>
