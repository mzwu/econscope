        <p class="lead"> At the Federal Reserve’s most recent meeting on January 26-27, officials generally agreed that low interest rates and bond purchases will have to continue into the foreseeable future to aid the U.S. labor market’s recovery from the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.   </p>

        <p>The officials believe that December’s federal stimulus package, coupled with widespread vaccine distribution, would help the U.S. economy improve in the coming months. Some officials believe that inflation might increase in the near future since the large-scale fiscal policy could lead to a surge in consumer spending in a safer economy. However, many are skeptical that inflation will rise to the extent that tight monetary policy would be necessary to combat price pressures. This is largely because economists believe that the labor market will recover more slowly than the larger economy, lowering their forecasts for the number of jobs expected to be created in 2021. Overall, Federal Reserve officials plan to continue current policies to achieve lower unemployment and 2% inflation.</p>

          <p>The Biden administration extended COVID-19 mortgage relief until June 30, 2021. The federal moratorium was originally set to end in January, but was extended to March by the Biden administration. The most recent update consists of a three month extension and also served to assist people on their mortgage payments who were behind due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This provides extra time for homeowners to request a pause or reduction in mortgage payments. =According to the White House, people of color are more likely to miss payments or defer them until later. Currently, many of the people who are delaying their payments have Federal Housing Administration loans. Most FHA loan borrowers typically have lower incomes, and many low-wage workers have lost their jobs from the COVID-19 pandemic from working in the service sector. The Biden administration wants to ensure that these groups of people aren’t pressured to pay back loans before the economy has had the chance to fully recover.</p>

          <p>According to a survey by the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment in the U.S. economy fell in early February. The consumer sentiment index, originally measuring 79.0 in January 2021, declined to 76.2 in February 2021, which measures the drop in confidence in future business conditions. This was also significantly lower than the consumer sentiment index in February of 2020, which was reported to be 101.0. This decline was concentrated among households whose yearly incomes are below $75,000. These households reported substantial concern over their current finances. The UMichigan survey’s chief economist stated that a future round of stimulus checks would likely provide financial relief to the households in the lowest third. The drop in consumer sentiment was likely due to a hiring slowdown that took place in December and January, as stated by the Labor Department. Despite this, initial applications for unemployment benefits have eased, which signals that the amount of layoffs have decreased slightly. Likewise, the consumer expectations index fell slightly from 86.7 in January to 86.2 in February, marking decreased anticipation for business conditions improvements in the next six months.</p>

          <p>Unemployment claims rose slightly to 0.861 million in the week that ended on February 13, 2021. By contrast, surveyed economists actually believed that the number of applications for unemployment benefits would decrease, signaling an improving labor market. Although the number of jobless claims is significantly lower than the COVID-19 pandemic peak of nearly 7 million, the reported figure for last week remains substantially higher than typical pre-pandemic figures. The number of weekly initial unemployment claims has remained somewhat steady since late August of 2020, gradually dipping and rising. In a more optimistic outlook, the newly proposed $1.9 trillion federal stimulus plan is likely to boost the labor market and contribute to its road to recovery. Business restrictions have also eased in some states, which will lead to rising employment and industry activity.</p>

          <p>While the service sector experienced deep declines in activity, factories in Europe and Japan reported greater activity in February. The COVID-19 pandemic had very selective impacts on different industries, with the most harmful effects on the service sector and small businesses that required close physical proximity to customers to prosper. The manufacturing industry, however, began to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic fairly quickly and has led much of the global economic recovery. Economists are optimistic that after mass distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the service sector will be able to pick up activity and heal from its long period of struggle. Germany’s purchasing managers composite output index rose from 50.8 in January to 51.3 in February, and Japan’s index increased from 47.1 in January to 47.6 in February. These indexes account for both boosts in the manufacturing sector and decreased activity in the service sector.</p>
