        <p class="lead"> China, the only economy to have not suffered from contraction from the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, has experienced an economic expansion of 2.3% in 2020.  </p>

          <p>In contrast, other large economies are all expected to shrink. For example, the World Bank predicts that the U.S. will have contracted by 3.6% and that the eurozone will have contracted by 7.4% in 2020. Looking at the combination of international economies as a whole, the global economy is expected to have contracted by 4.3% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After suffering a 6.8% contraction in the first quarter of 2020, China’s GDP rebounded with a 3.2% expansion in the second quarter, a 4.9% GDP growth in the third quarter, and a 6.5% expansion in the final quarter of 2020. These official reports surpassed economist expectations, as it was projected for China to expand by only 6% in the fourth quarter. This time of year is around one year after the first COVID-19 cases were reported in Wuhan. Unlike western countries that focused on lowering interest rates and pumping money into the economy, China combatted the economic consequences by restarting factors and keeping interest rates high. Although economic growth in 2020 marks China’s lowest growth rate since 1976, its positive expansion sets the nation back on its trajectory toward long-term economic growth.</p>

          <p>Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary nominee, has put forth her support for additional federal borrowing to aid the economy in the short run. Currently, U.S. debt has reached $21.6 trillion, which exceeds the nation’s output at 100.1% of U.S. gross domestic product. Those in favor of increasing short-term spending argue that interest rates will remain low for years, making it financially easier to borrow more. Ms. Yellen was the White House Council of Economic Advisors chairwoman in the 1990s, Federal Reserve chairwoman in the 2010s, and is now preparing for the role of Treasury secretary in the 2020s after an international economic disaster from the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to the 1990s when economists had encouraged private sector investment, economists are now advocating for government borrowing to make up for lack of private sector investment activity. If confirmed as the next U.S. Treasury secretary, Ms. Yellen plans to focus on providing adequate wages and jobs in rural and urban areas. She urges additional spending and big actions to avoid serious, long-term economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>The Paycheck Protection Program reopened last week, allowing approximately 60,000 borrowers to receive over $5 billion in forgivable loans from the Small Business Administration. The PPP closed in August 2020, but was reopened on January 11, 2021. The program was restarted since many small businesses across the nation continue to struggle from the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a Census Bureau survey that took place between January 4 and January 10, 2021, a third of small businesses reported that they would need financial assistance in the next six months, which marks an increase from the 25% proportion reported in November of 2020. The Small Business Administration reported that first-time borrowers had an average loan size of under $20,000, and that second-time borrowers had an average loan size of under $75,000. These figures demonstrate that the PPP is reaching smaller businesses. By contrast, the average loan size at the start of the PPP in April 2020 was $206,000 and the average loan size at the PPP’s closure in August was $101,000. This time around, the PPP is making an effort to reach underrepresented demographics, including minorities, women, veterans, and more.</p>

          <p>U.S. unemployment claims fell slightly to 0.9 million in the week that ended on January 16, 2021. Jobless claims remain highly elevated from pre-pandemic levels. Due to rising COVID-19 cases across the nation, states are enacting new restrictions that limit business activity. For example, restaurants are being forced to reduce their maximum capacity. Additionally, consumers are still hesitant to engage in activities that require relatively close physical proximity to others, including eating indoors at restaurants or seeing a movie at a movie theater. In the January Wall Street Journal survey, economists expect that economic growth will pick up later in 2021, especially since President Joe Biden is planning on providing $1.9 trillion in federal aid. Economists expect that U.S. GDP will grow 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the previous year. This projection increased from the previously forecasted 3.7% growth rate.</p>
