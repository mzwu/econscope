        <p class="lead"> The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on state and local governments was immense, as millions of business closures and layoffs eliminated much of tax revenue.   </p>

        <p>Even though the federal government has provided numerous aid programs and stimulus checks totaling $300 billion to boost household incomes and push unemployment down, state and local governments still expected that the COVID-19 pandemic would have lasting effects on government revenue. However, figures show that the hit from COVID-19 onto state and local revenues will actually be less severe than expected. According to the National Association of State Budget Officers, while most states expected a 4.4% revenue decline in fiscal 2021, eighteen states are actually forecasted to experience positive revenue gain. Despite the lessening in severity of the revenue issue for state and local governments, there still may be cause for concern since state and local spending has seen a surge in spending on health care, unemployment aid, and food support. Revenue losses and gains may also vary significantly across states and districts, so the final impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are still uncertain.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell believes that “a patiently accommodative monetary-policy stance” will help the labor market return to its pre-pandemic conditions, which currently remains deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is very unlikely that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates or slow down its bond purchases in the near future. In addition to monetary policy, Chairman Powell is calling for extra fiscal policy to support the economy in its path to recovery. Mr. Powell advocates for a widespread effort in helping the labor market recover and aiding currently unemployed workers to find jobs. Despite optimistic outlooks on the economic growth of the US in 2021, Federal Reserve officials largely agree that the US unemployment level won’t return to its pre-pandemic rate until the year 2023. Unemployment is a crucial issue to tackle, since long spells of unemployment can severely harm the livelihood of Americans and their families.</p>

          <p>According to Indeed, job postings increased 0.7% in January 2021 from February 2020. The number of job postings fell to a low in May 2020 and has climbed upward since then, although the growth rate has slowed in recent months. A few industries have carried the initial strength of this job growth, including warehousing, construction, and delivery services. These industries experienced a quick initial jump in job growth shortly after the lowest economic point of the COVID-19 pandemic and have stayed roughly steady ever since. Recently, a few other industries have picked up pace in job postings, such as technology and finance. In addition, many small businesses have increased hiring in recent weeks and months, especially as they anticipate greater distribution of vaccines in the near future. However, certain industries continue to sustain low employment figures. For example, job openings in the hospitality and tourism sector are currently 37.9% less than in February 2020. The arts and entertainment industry currently has 16.8% less job postings than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>The U.S. budget deficit widened in January 2021, since federal spending increased due to the Treasury’s recent round of stimulus checks as a part of the December federal stimulus bill. Of the $142 billion in stimulus payments outlined by Congress in the late 2020 bill, $139 billion worth of payments were made in January 2021. The Treasury also ramped up spending to aid state and local governments, the Agriculture Department, and the Labor Department. In the first third of fiscal 2021, the U.S. budget gap amounted to a record $736 billion, marking an 89% increase from the previous year. Federal spending included $1.2 trillion in receipts and $1.9 trillion on outlays, which includes higher spending on unemployment aid and Medicaid. The combination of rapid federal spending and weaker tax revenues have contributed to historically high budget deficit figures. Although federal revenues have improved since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, revenues for the twelve months that ended in January 2021 remain 2.8% lower than the previous year.</p>
