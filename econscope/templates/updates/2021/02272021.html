        <p class="lead"> Adewale Adeyemo, Biden’s candidate for deputy Treasury secretary, believes that economic inequality is the biggest challenge in a post-COVID-19 economy.   </p>

          <p>At his confirmation hearing, Adeyemo stated that we must “unlock the unrealized potential of marginalized people in this country in order to grow our economy and make sure that we’re competitive going forward.” An immigrant from Nigeria, Adeyemo will become the first Black deputy secretary of the Treasury if confirmed. Adeyemo expressed his support for the proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 federal stimulus bill, stating that the possible consequences of providing too little support to the U.S. economy exceed the risks of possibly increasing inflation. Talked highly of by his colleagues and peers, Adeyemo has a strong background in economic policy. He is not only focused on helping the U.S. economy recover from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession, but also on laying “the groundwork for years of economic prosperity and opportunity.”</p>

          <p>Blue-collar jobs, those that involve manual labor, have boosted the labor market. Currently, residential construction, package delivery, and warehousing jobs have surpassed pre-pandemic levels of employment. Although unemployment across all sectors remain 5% lower than before the COVID-19 pandemic, blue-collar employment has risen significantly according to the online job site Indeed. The main contributors to this rise in blue-collar employment are boosts in the housing market and an increase in e-commerce and online purchases. Unlike previous recessions, the economy experienced increases in available jobs relating to these fields. Many economists expect for blue-collar jobs to continue rising in availability, even if the growth rate slows in the future. Even after mass distribution of vaccines and a shift in consumer demand from goods to services, demand for warehouse workers and other blue-collar workers will continue to thrive. These effects will greatly benefit workers in the housing market, as they are seeing an abundance of job opportunities.</p>

          <p>Weekly initial unemployment claims fell to 730,000 in the week that ended on February 20, 2021, marking the lowest figure since mid-March of 2020. In addition, the total number of people receiving continued unemployment benefits from regular state programs decreased to 4.419 million in the week that ended on February 13, 2021. This was a positive surprise, as economists previously expected jobless claims to remain steady through February. While this drop is a signal that the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are easing, this trend could discontinue due to the winter storms in the south. Texas experienced damaging power outages and other energy disruptions, which could possibly result in greater temporary unemployment. There could also be a delay in processing unemployment claims, which will be reflected in later reports. Overall, economists are still forecasting recovery for the labor market in 2021. According to a Wall Street Journal, economists expect 4.8 million jobs to be added to the U.S. economy this year.</p>

          <p>Due to the additional round of federal stimulus to individual households, household income increased 10% in January 2021. Consumer spending also rose 2.4%, the first increase since October of 2020, which leads economists to believe that the economy is on a healthy path to recovery. According to the Commerce Department, January’s increase in household income was the second highest, topped only by April of 2020 when the federal government sent out its first round of stimulus payments. With greater household income, households hold more to save and spend. Consumer spending is a crucial factor of economic growth, since the COVID-19 pandemic led to business shutdowns and restricted consumer spending. Oxford Economics projects a 7% increase in output during 2021, which would mark the most growth in the past few decades. This forecast was higher than sentiment given by economists in a Wall Street Journal poll, in which they expected gross domestic product to increase by 4.9% this year.</p>

          <p>In the year that ended with December of 2020, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index rose 10.4%, which was an increase from the previous month’s index of 9.5%. This rise in index portrays the increase in average home prices across major metropolitan areas in the U.S. This shows that home-price growth in the U.S. accelerated at the end of 2020, since the number of houses on the market started to drop. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and near-zero interest rates, the demand to buy houses has surged in recent months. In fact, according to the National Association of Realtors, the year 2020 contained the highest number of previously owned house sales since 2006. As the supply of houses on the market is becoming limited, potential buyers are competing for homes and driving up prices. Economists expect for house prices to continue to increase in the future. This increase will be boosted by select cities such as Phoenix, Arizona, which reportedly has had the fastest home-price growth for 19 consecutive months.</p>
