        <p class="lead"> In 1983, economic growth in the U.S. reached 7.9%. Since then, economic growth has never come near that level - until this year, according to economic forecasts.  </p>

        <p>Economists in a Wall Street Journal survey reported that they expect the U.S. economy to expand by 6.4% in 2021, which is a historically high rate. In the following year, economists project a 3.2% economic expansion. Although this sounds like great news, inflation could introduce turbulent situations. The consumer price index (CPI), which is a measure of inflation, is forecasted to rise sharply in March data, which is soon to be released. Inflation in February was reported to be 1.7%. However, as the spring and summer seasons bring economic growth, prices are expected to rise as well. In fact, some expect inflation to rise to as much as 3% by June of 2021. Especially since coupled with immense amounts of federal stimulus, economic expansion may serve to push inflation up into unwanted levels. The Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2% may likely be surpassed soon, and once reached, the central bank may start raising interest rates from near zero.</p>

        <p>In fact, the Labor Department reported that the CPI in March 2021 rose 0.6% from the previous month and 2.6% from March of last year. This reflects an increase in the average price of a basket of everyday items, including groceries, apparel, services, and others expenses. Energy prices increased by 9.1%, with gasoline prices fueling this upward climb. The core CPI, which excludes volatile categories such as food and energy, increased 0.3% from February and a year-long increase of 1.6%. Inflation is expected to continue rising for the following months, after remaining mostly stagnant since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The combination of greater vaccine distribution, eased restrictions on businesses, and greater federal stimulus pumped into the economy will likely lead to greater aggregate demand. In addition, economists project that the U.S. gross domestic product will expand by 8.1% during the second quarter of 2021. Along with this expansion, economists expect to see higher prices and higher interest rates.</p>

        <p>Recent updates in economic measures suggest that the U.S. has not strayed from its path of strong recovery. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales, which measures sales at stores, restaurants, and online, increased by 9.8% in March. This jump in consumer spending came largely from the massive federal stimulus that has recently reached households. Additionally, the number of weekly initial unemployment claims dropped by 200,000 last week to 576,000, according to the Labor Department. This marks the lowest amount of weekly jobless claims since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The total amount of people receiving unemployment benefits fell from 18.2 million to 16.9 million just a week later. Furthermore, industrial output rose from February to March, which includes a 2.7% increase in factory production alone. Current forecasts from economists show projections of a 6.4% overall U.S. economic growth in 2021, which is an increase from the previous month’s prediction of a 5.95% economic expansion.</p>

        <p>Since June 2020, the Federal Reserve has purchased billions of dollars worth of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities each month to stabilize the financial market after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ever since then, the central bank has been monitoring the economy closely, waiting for signs of significant economic improvement until they decide to draw back these purchases and other measures it has taken. When the labor market reaches full employment and inflation is projected to surpass 2%, the Federal Reserve will consider raising interest rates above near zero. Recently, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the central bank will sooner slow down bond purchases than raise interest rates. In fact, many officials at the Federal Reserve believe that interest rates will remain near zero through the year 2023. Although the CPI recently jumped, signaling a rise in inflation, handling inflation is tricky and some are worried that inflation may overshoot targeted levels.</p>
