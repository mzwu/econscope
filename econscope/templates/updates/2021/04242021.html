        <p class="lead"> As the economy expands more rapidly, employers might not be able to hire workers to keep up with the pace of economic growth and increasing activity.     </p>

        <p>With recent developments such as greater COVID-19 vaccine distribution and reception of federal stimulus checks, activity at restaurants, hotels, and salons have started to pick up. However, employment might not grow at the same pace as economic growth, which can result in bottlenecks as well as wage and price pressures. For sectors and industries that rely on close proximity in their work, they might suffer a lack of labor for the increase in demand for their services. Economists predict that U.S. gross domestic product will increase by 6.4% in 2021, meaning that real output increases by 4% as compared to the nationâ€™s pre-pandemic GDP. In addition, employers are forecasted to add 7.1 million jobs to the labor market between December 2020 and December 2021, which would mark a 5% increase. As of recent, employers are hesitant to pick up hiring due to uncertainty with the COVID-19 pandemic, not knowing whether more outbreaks or stricter business restrictions are in our imminent future. In addition, businesses have not fully returned to pre-pandemic conditions, with lingering questions about permanent weaker demand and the possibility of business travel.</p>

        <p>Currently, total employment in the U.S. is 8.4 million less than the peak before the COVID-19 pandemic, which is comparable to the employment effects of the 2008 financial crisis. The unemployment rate is 6% lower than it was in 2009, but this figure may be misleading since it does not account for those who are unemployed and not actively seeking work, suggesting that the labor market is slack. Although it may seem as if the labor market is in poor shape, economists actually report the labor market to look tightened. Unlike during other recessions, wage growth has not dropped significantly; earnings have actually increased from a year ago, contrary to the aftermath of the 2008 recession. Moreover, employers are facing difficulties filling job vacancies. This has been supported through anecdotes and data, since there are currently twice as many unfilled job vacancies than there were immediately following the 2008 crisis. These contrasts largely stem from structural differences between the two recessions, with the current pandemic mostly affecting workers that do not have much incentive to reenter the labor force.</p>

        <p>According to the Labor Department, weekly initial unemployment claims fell by 39,000 down to 547,000 in the week that ended on April 17, marking a record low point since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The four-week moving average, which smooths out week-to-week fluctuations, dropped to a pandemic low of 651,000. The fall in unemployment claims has led economists to be more optimistic about continuing drops in the upcoming weeks. As COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed and business restrictions are being lifted, jobs have been added and filled in the labor market. In addition, the number of layoffs has also dropped as industry activity has picked up. Economists have commented positively on the noticeable improvements in the labor market that will likely boost economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.</p>

        <p>Although the European Central Bank has provided huge amounts of stimulus for the eurozone economy through buying bonds, lending to banks at low interest rates, and even enacting negative interest rates, its recent lending survey suggests that companies are still hesitant to take out loans and credit lines. Unlike the U.S. economy, the eurozone is facing a persistent lack of business confidence a year into the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, new resurgences of COVID-19 have caused governments to enforce stricter business restrictions in European nations. Compared to companies in the U.S., European firms typically rely more heavily on bank loans, which means that the market for loans is a substantial indicator of economic health and activity in the eurozone. Gradually, banks have tightened their loan approval criteria, and the ECB reported that margins on loans have narrowed on average. ECB policymakers, while doing as much as they can to aid the economy, realize that the eurozone is not as advanced as other economies when it comes to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
