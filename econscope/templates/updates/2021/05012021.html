        <p class="lead"> Starting May 3, the Small Business Administration will begin accepting applications for a grant program focused on aiding the restaurant industry.     </p>

        <p>The Restaurant Revitalization Fund is worth $29 billion and was part of the $1.9 trillion federal emergency stimulus package passed by Congress. This program marks the first federal program providing aid exclusively to restaurants, bars, and food services. According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant and bar sales totaled $659 billion in 2020, which was almost 25% less than in 2019. Food services were clearly one of the industries most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, since they rely on in-person dining services and close proximity between customers and employees. As a result, restaurant owners lobbied for funding directed to boost their services and for restrictions to be lifted so that restaurants can return to normal activity. Through the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, eligible businesses will receive monetary aid of up to $10 million to make up their revenue loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other than restaurants and bars, eligible recipients include food trucks, caterers, cafes, distilleries, breweries, and others.</p>

          <p>According to the Conference Board, the Consumer Confidence Index has risen sharply in the past couple months, from 90.4 in February 2021 to 121.7 in April 2021, the highest the index has reached since more than a year ago. April marks the fourth consecutive month of increases in consumer confidence, which likely stems from greater distribution of vaccines, reception of household stimulus payments, and reopening businesses. The Consumer Confidence Index reflects US consumersâ€™ outlook on business and labor market conditions. The present situation index measures current assessment on businesses and the labor market, and it has increased significantly from 110.1 in March to 139.6 in April. The expectations index measures future short-term expectations for businesses and the labor market, and this measure has also increased from 108.3 in March to 109.8 in April. These optimistic indicators suggest that American consumers acknowledge the economic recovery the US has experienced and are hopeful that activity and demand will return to somewhat normal conditions.</p>

          <p>According to the Commerce Department, new durable goods orders rose 0.5% from February to March, reaching a seasonally adjusted $256.3 billion. Durable goods are defined as those that can last more than three years, including technological devices.The volume of durable goods orders in March 2021 was 25.02% larger than a year ago in March 2020. After supply chain disruptions in previous months, the increase in orders reflect signs that the U.S. continues to move along its path to economic recovery. The effects of supply chain difficulties are still felt in certain industries, but their impacts have waned over time. In the past eleven months, the U.S. has experienced increasing durable goods orders in all but one month. Due to greater distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across the nation, as well as the reception and usage of federal stimulus payments, consumer spending has boosted which is stimulating aggregate demand. Service industries that sustained especially hard impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including restaurants, hotels, and airlines, have been experiencing greater activity in recent months.</p>

          <p>U.S. gross domestic product grew 6.4% in the first quarter of 2021, according to the Commerce Department. The U.S. GDP level in Q1 of 2021 was within 1% of the overall U.S. GDP peak of $19.25 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Economists have commented on the unexpectedly rapid recovery of the U.S. economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the nation a little over a year ago in March 2020. U.S. GDP plummeted to its nadir in the second quarter of 2020 with a measure of $17.3 trillion, which was the result of a 31.4% drop in output from the previous quarter. At the lowest point during the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment reached 14% and other measures of economic performance and confidence dropped. Due to quick federal response, Congress passed numerous stimulus packages worth $5 trillion and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero. Vaccines have also been rapidly distributed throughout the past few months, which was accompanied by an increase in consumer spending and consumer confidence in the U.S. economy.</p>
