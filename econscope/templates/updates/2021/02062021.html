        <p class="lead"> According to the Congressional Budget Office, U.S. gross domestic product is expected to reach pre-pandemic levels by the midpoint of 2021.   </p>

        <p>Much of this economic growth is due to federal stimulus spending released in 2020, which will be further boosted by plans for an upcoming COVID-19 relief bill. In the fourth quarter of 2021, GDP is projected to grow by 3.7%. Additionally, in 2022, GDP is forecasted to expand 2.4%. However, it could take years for U.S. output to reach its full potential and regain its previous employment rate. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that output will remain below its full potential until 2025, and that the U.S. won’t reach its pre-pandemic employment amount until 2024. The Congressional Budget Office reported that the unemployment rate will fall to around 5.3% by the end of 2021, compared with 6.8% at the end of 2020. The agency also expects higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years than previously estimated.</p>

        <p>Despite significant progress in the U.S. and smaller countries in efforts to vaccinate much of their population by the start of fall, other regions such as Europe, Asia, and Latin America are facing vaccination delays that could set back the global health and economic rebound. Some countries are struggling to source sufficient vaccines, and others are not as eager to start mass vaccine distribution. According to UBS, only 10% of the global population will be vaccinated this year if vaccination rates continue at the current rate. In addition, only ten countries are projected to vaccinate over one third of their population by the end of 2021. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the U.S. economy will expand by 5.1% in 2021, but developing countries and the eurozone are facing vaccination delays that could hinder their economic growth. Inconsistent vaccine distribution could mean that COVID-19 will continue to circulate for years into the future, putting vulnerable nations at risk for prolonged economic shock. Although the service sector will experience activity boosts in some areas, other facilities such as schools, hotels, and airports will still face business hardships.</p>

        <p>Out of the small businesses that participated in a survey by Federal Reserve regional banks, 90% reported that they have not yet reached pre-pandemic levels of output and activity, 30% of which said that their companies might not have survived without government support and stimulus. The survey encompassed almost 10,000 responses from businesses with at most 500 employees. Almost all of the respondents reported experiencing harmful effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, with 78% reporting a fall in income and almost 50% reporting that they had to engage in layoffs to meet reduced demand. Additionally, more than 50% of the firms surveyed said that revenue in the past year had likely fallen more than 25%. Although this survey was targeted directly toward small business owners, the Federal Reserve said that this data is likely applicable to 99.7% of all employers in the U.S. As the Biden administration is considering plans for another round of federal stimulus, this survey will prove useful in assessing the conditions of the U.S. economy.</p>

        <p>One of the most drastic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic was the surge in unemployment rates. Almost a month after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., unemployment rates still remain substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels, currently stalling at a level of 6.7% in December and November of 2020. The Biden administration and Federal Reserve are determined to settle back into the 3.5% pre-pandemic unemployment rate, which economists classify as the approximate “full employment.” According to the Congressional Budget Office, the jobless rate in the U.S. is higher than full employment levels in the majority of months dating back a few decades. From the 1950s to 2010s, the percentage of months in which the jobless rate exceeded full employment displayed an overall increasing trend from a little over 25% to nearly 75%. Economists from the Brookings Institution have reported that the newly proposed $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package will push unemployment rates down to 3.2% in late 2021 and early 2022, increasing optimism for the Biden administration’s plan.</p>

        <p>In January 2021, U.S. employers added 49,000 jobs to the U.S. economy. The unemployment rate fell from 6.7% in December to 6.3% in January. This is partially due to people in long-term unemployment exiting the labor force, since they are no longer actively searching for employment. Although the net gain in jobs is positive, meaning that more people have reported themselves as employed, we currently stand almost 10 million jobs less than we had in February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Sectors that have the highest increase in payrolls in January 2021 include temporary help, local government education, professional and technical services, and other education services. In contrast, the sectors with the largest loss in payrolls include nursing and residential care, electronics and appliance retailers, transportation and warehousing, and the federal government.</p>
