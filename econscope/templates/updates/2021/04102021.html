        <p class="lead"> The U.S.’s drought in worker productivity could end as businesses invest more in labor-saving technology as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>

        <p>This technological adoption could boost economic growth and lift wages while counteracting any inflationary pressures. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S., businesses found that they had to adapt to minimal close physical contact with customers. Therefore, many businesses had to learn to use video conferencing platforms, electronic commerce, and telemedicine. In fact, nonfarm business productivity surged in the second quarter of 2020 as many low-wage workers lost their jobs. Regarding specific technologies, business investment increased 17% in computer equipment, 7% in automation, 6% in software, and 1% in research. Many companies surveyed by a McKinsey Global Institute analysis also showed greater enthusiasm for investing in new technologies than a year earlier. This new boom in technology utilization is raising productivity, output for each hour of labor, which in turn is expanding the capacity for economic growth in the long term.</p>

        <p>The International Monetary Fund raised its prediction for global economic expansion in 2021 from 5.5% in January to 6% in April. If met, this growth rate would mark the largest expansion since 1980. The world’s largest economies, the U.S. and China, are the driving forces of this expansion. The IMF projects a 6.4% economic growth for the U.S. and an 8.4% expansion for China in 2021. Much of this projected economic expansion is a result of daily life regaining normality as vaccines are distributed and countries ease lockdown restrictions. Many economies have also enacted large sums of federal stimulus aid and emergency lending programs, as well as monetary policy strategies such as lowering interest rates and buying securities; such countries include the U.S., Japan, the U.K., as well as nations in the European Union. However, other countries that are less developed and might have relied more on tourism and commodity exports prior to the COVID-19 pandemic might not experience such drastic steps toward economic recovery.</p>

        <p>According to the Commerce Department, U.S. exports declined 2.6% in February, bringing the volume of exports down to $187.3 billion, which marks the first decrease since May of last year. Similarly, the U.S. trade deficit expanded 4.8% to a record high of $71.1 billion. The energy, food, capital goods, and automotive vehicles industries drove the decline in exports in February 2021, since these exporters have faced disruptions such as weather delays, port congestion, and rising shipping rates. Imports also fell 0.7% in February, which was not enough to compensate for the significant drop in exports. Economists and other officials expect for the U.S. trade deficit to remain high as the economy speeds up in recovery, which will lead to higher imports as a result of greater consumer spending on foreign goods. Although supply chain disruptions have reversed the trade path of the U.S., officials project greater trade flows as the global economy begins to reopen.</p>

        <p>In the week that ended on April 3, the Labor Department reported 744,000 initial weekly unemployment claims. This was a 16,000 increase from the previous week, but the amount of jobless claims has remained near its lowest levels since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 916,000 jobs were added by employers in March of 2021, and the unemployment rate dropped to 6% from the prior month’s 6.2%. The number of people continuing to receive unemployment benefits is falling, and the U.S. is still on a steady path to economic recovery. The number of job postings on the site Indeed were 16.41% higher than February 1, 2020 as of April 2, 2021. Of the sectors that are experiencing greater job demand include manufacturing and loading and stocking occupations. These jobs were not terribly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and are currently more than 50% greater than in February last year. As vaccines continue to roll out and restrictions are eased, consumers are spending more at in-person services. The combination of labor-market improvement and boosted consumer spending are optimistic signs of stronger economic recovery for the U.S.</p>
