        <p class="lead"> As consumers ramp up spending on travel and restaurant dining, forecasts for the U.S. economy have risen to reflect more optimistic expectations.    </p>

        <p>The rise in consumer confidence has led forecasters to predict a stronger and faster recovery for the U.S. economy. Consumer spending has picked up for in-person services that struggled from low demand and industry restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as restaurants, hotels, airlines, gyms, salons, and spas. Compared to economists’ February prediction of a 4.87% growth between the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2021, their March predictions for economic growth have risen to 5.95%. A yearly growth rate of 5.95% would mark the largest economic expansion in nearly 40 years. These early signs of economic growth regarding consumer spending are arriving earlier than expected, since the $1.9 trillion federal stimulus bill has not yet been approved by Congress. While the aforementioned services have experienced great boosts, capacity and activity is still significantly lower than before the COVID-19 pandemic. As more COVID-19 vaccines are distributed, economists expect that people will be more comfortable with close proximity to others, contributing to the recovery of the service sector.</p>

        <p>Although he recognized the significant recovery efforts achieved by the U.S. economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that U.S.’s economic recovery is “far from complete.” He also said that the Federal Reserve “will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes.” This support entails keeping interest rates low for years to come, as well as making monthly purchases of $120 billion worth of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities. With regard to the upcoming $1.9 trillion federal stimulus package, Chairman Powell stated that prices might experience some upward pressure, but that he doesn’t expect it to introduce large or persistent inflation in the overall U.S. price level. Chairman Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen both expect strong economic growth in the next year as vaccine distribution picks up, but have a modest outlook on the role of economic stimulus and support in the long-run recovery path.</p>

        <p>As the U.S. economy experiences its strongest expansion in the past three decades, supply chains are becoming increasingly pressured which could lead to further disruption. These disruptions could exacerbate the severity of shortages and drive up consumer prices. The automobile industry has taken the largest hit, in which limited supply of semiconductors has forced manufacturers to decrease production. Recently, the Suez Canal was blocked by a grounded container ship, and a factory of one of the top auto chip producers experienced a fire. Additionally, the recent winter storms in Texas have caused petrochemical plants to close. All of these disruptions will likely lead to longer delivery times for factors of production, increased backlogs, and increased prices of input resources. Trends from around the world show that the purchasing managers index for input prices are increasing, while the purchasing managers index for suppliers' delivery times is falling. Economists believe that these supply chain disruptions will stall recovery temporarily, but do not seem to harm global economic recovery in the long run.</p>

        <p>Unemployment claims in the week that ended on March 20, 2021, marked the lowest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic at 684,000 claims. This amount of jobless claims is also below the pre-pandemic peak of 695,000, which hasn’t been passed in an entire year. A labor economist stated that the U.S. economic recovery is starting to pick up and will likely be further boosted by greater vaccinations in the summer and later this year. The four-week average for unemployment claims, another indicator of unemployment that smooths out week-to-week volatility, also fell to its lowest level in the pandemic. Along with improvements in the labor market, economists are lifting expectations for economic growth in 2021 due to increased consumer spending, easing business restrictions, and widespread vaccine distribution. These improvements have occurred even before the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill was signed into law, so figures are likely upward-looking from this point. The package provided stimulus checks to those qualified, which will ease pressure on households and spur aggregate demand.</p>
