        <p class="lead"> According to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve might have to raise interest rates if Biden’s spending plans are put into law.    </p>

        <p>The presidential administration has proposed $4 trillion of spending on infrastructure, research and development, child care, paid family leave, among other social programs to be implemented in the next decade. In addition, the Labor Department reported that the consumer price index (CPI) increased 2.6% in the year that ended in March, signaling that inflation is on the rise. The Federal Reserve has previously stated its intent to raise interest rates when inflation reaches a steady 2%, but it uses a different measure that tends to be lower than the CPI. Yellen stated that interest rates may have to rise moderately to prevent the economy from overheating. However, a large percentage of Federal Reserve officials still expect for interest rates to remain extremely low until 2023. In addition, stock prices remained low after Yellen’s remarks: this suggests that investors’ expectations for the interest rate did not change much. This was likely due to the already existing outlook that interest rates will rise sometime in the next couple years.</p>

        <p>The service sector continued to grow and recover during April of 2021, which was evident through increases in purchasing managers services output indices. However, different countries are experiencing different developments regarding economic recovery and vaccine distribution. India is experiencing a devastating surge in COVID-19 cases, with more than 1 million new cases in the past week. Even though India has reimposed restrictions to contain the COVID-19 virus, its PMI remained roughly steady at 54, which indicates expansion in its service sector. Looking at other parts of the global economy, many employers are picking up additional hiring which lowers unemployment and increases sector activity. Other countries, including Italy, continue to experience contractions in its service sector. Germany has also experienced decreases in service activity, after an expansion the month prior. The eurozone’s economy as a whole has remained stagnant for the previous two quarters, and is likely to continue this trend into the next quarter. Overall, restrictions are still getting in the way of economic recovery, since boosted economic activity is needed to counteract the lasting harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <p>Consumer spending is an integral part of economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, because increased consumer spending leads to an increase in aggregate demand, which plays a key role in bringing an economy out of a downturn. It is widely known that millions of people suffered from layoffs and long-term unemployment, losing much of their household income. On the flipside, households from wealthy countries actually accumulated a large amount of savings over this period of pandemic and quarantine. In essence, these households have the power to accelerate economic recovery much more, but economists are unsure whether they will choose to do so. The accumulation of so much in savings in such a short period of time has never occurred before, so economists say that predicting consumer behavior in this situation is filled with uncertainty. Even so, economists are looking at different demographics and their respective tendencies to save and spend in order to figure out a rough pattern. Because much of this new wealth has accumulated into the hands of the richest fifth of the nation, economists do not expect for a rapid increase in consumer spending. On the other hand, they might be more incentivized to spend on leisure and hospitality services once fully vaccinated.</p>

        <p>According to a report by the Labor Department, 266,000 jobs were added by U.S. employers in April. This was a small amount of job growth compared to trends over previous months. Originally, economists had predicted that nearly 1 million jobs would be added in April, but reality came short of this expectation. In addition, the unemployment rate in April was reported to be 6.1%, a small increase from the previous month’s rate of 6%. Despite positive indicators such as greater vaccination rates and eased business restrictions across the nation, it is evident that employers are still cautious about returning to pre-pandemic levels of hiring and output. Specifically, the supply and demand for goods is still volatile, so companies are hesitant to rapidly return to full levels of production inputs and workers. Some workers are even choosing to continue receiving extensive unemployment benefits, since returning to work means greater risk of contracting COVID-19. Recently, while payrolls rose in March, many jobs in the transportation, manufacturing, and retail industries were lost. The labor market is evidently experiencing difficulties matching up labor supply to labor demand, which could have lasting effects on the U.S. economy.</p>
