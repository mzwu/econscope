        <p class="lead">  Ever since reaching a low in early May, job postings have been gradually increasing, displaying a rise in labor market activity.  </p>

        <p>However, the rate at which job postings have been increasing has slowed down significantly starting in late July. The number of job openings leveled off in late summer, signaling that recovery for the labor market is slowing. Currently, the number of job postings is 20% down from this time in 2019 and 12% down from early February from this year. Despite this overall ease in the labor market, different sectors are experiencing different labor demand. For example, labor demand flattened for food service, retail, and drivers, whereas labor demand for construction and loading and stocking has returned to their 2019 levels.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are in agreement that they do not want to see a government shutdown to avoid hits to government workers and projects, therefore planning on a continuing resolution, or short-term spending bill, separately from the discussion regarding COVID-19 funding. Republicans are expected to move forward with a “skinny” aid proposal of less than $1 trillion this week, which Democrats have labeled as “emaciated.” However, both parties are in favor of avoiding a government shutdown as the presidential election is nearing and the economy is slowly recovering from a deep recession. The Senate Republican proposal includes $1.5 trillion of funding that covers $300 weekly unemployment benefits through the end of December 2020, legal protections for businesses and health care facilities, funding for schools and health care, as well as debt relief for the U.S. Postal Service. On the other hand, Democrats are concerned that these efforts do not address all of their ideals, such as increasing food-stamp benefits.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in August of 2020, indicating that prices for a variety of goods are rising and inflation is adapting to healthier levels. According to Labor Department data, August marked the third straight month that the U.S. experienced a rise in consumer prices. Used-vehicle prices have rebounded especially well, with a 5.4% increase last month which accounted for 40% of core price increases. Gas, shelter, and apparel prices also increased last month, whereas food and home prices fell slightly. These statistics signal both changes in consumer preference as well as disruptions in certain businesses and sectors.</p>

          <p>Even through a period of economic suffering from the long-lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortgage market is experiencing a boom. The mortgage market underwent its best quarter in years during the spring of 2020. Between April and June, lenders issued $1.1 trillion in home loans, displaying a greatly increased rate from the total of $2.5 trillion lent during the entirety of 2019. After jumping 25% in July 2020, home prices have steadily increased, hindering the possibility of homeownership for many Americans. Overall, the housing and mortgage markets proved to be incredibly resilient during this time of what is hardship and economic downfall for other sectors.</p>

          <p>In a monthly Wall Street Journal survey, economists reported that the overall U.S. economy is recovering faster than expected. In the most recent survey, economists expected GDP to increase at an annualized rate of 23.9% in the third quarter of 2020, as compared to 18.3% in a previous survey. Despite positive indicators such as increased job openings and decreasing unemployment rates, many economists are still worried about the economy’s rebound with regards to containing COVID-19 and creating a vaccine.</p>
