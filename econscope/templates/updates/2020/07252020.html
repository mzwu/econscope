        <p class="lead">  The U.S. entered a recession starting in March, with the economy declining at the fastest rate since the Great Depression a century ago.  </p>

          <p>Measures from the past month have indicated economic recovery in terms of employment, retail sales, manufacturing indices, and more, but officials believe that the country will not be able to make a full recovery until a COVID-19 vaccine is available. Without a vaccine, any sudden surge in cases in the future would surely hinder the efforts to rebuild our economy. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta approximated that U.S. second quarter GDP declined 10.3% in comparison to the first quarter, which is four times worse than the largest quarterly decline during the 2008 financial crisis. Rising cases across the country will likely lead to state restrictions and stay-at-home orders, putting the economy back to where it originally was at the start of the pandemic. According to Former Federal Reserve governor Randall S. Kroszner, an economist at the Chicago Booth School of Business, governments must improve data collection to quickly identify, contain, and treat local outbreaks.</p>

          <p>With the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits expiring July 31st, Congress is deciding whether to extend these benefits or alter the system. Alternate options include offering a lower flat payment, offer return-to-work bonuses, or capping benefits at 100% of the worker’s income prior to the pandemic. Implementing these alterations could prove to be a heavy burden for some states, as these additional calculations could take weeks of computer programming changes. Possible challenges that states could run into as a result of Congress’ plans include automation issues, difficulty determining eligibility for return-to-work bonuses, and workers being discouraged to work because they receive the weekly benefits which can keep unemployment at high levels. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of the Treasury alleviated some of the U.S. tax burden on U.S.-based multinational corporations that are operating in foreign countries with high taxes such as Germany or Japan.In 2017, Congress created the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax law that required U.S. corporations to pay a certain tax if their foreign tax rates fall below a certain threshold. On Monday, July 20, the Treasury asserted that companies with foreign tax rates greater than 18.9% would not be required to pay the GILTI tax. Among the companies that benefited from this change include Freeport McMoRan Inc., Corning Inc. and Hanesbrands Inc.</p>

          <p> According to Oxxford Information Technology Ltd., almost 2 million businesses shut down in the second quarter of 2020, many of which opened back up in mid-April as states eased restrictions. Ever since then, the percentage of business reopenings have slowly crept back up. Over the two months of May and June, 7.5 million jobs were added back to the job market. Among the industries that regained the most workers include health-care providers, logistics, restaurants, general merchandise stores, construction, and manufacturing. However, as COVID-19 cases start climbing up again in May and June, these businesses may have no choice but to suspend operations once again. Small businesses, especially those that offer face-to-face services, are at higher risk for greater losses. Businesses that can still operate virtually are less vulnerable to layoffs and shutdowns. Many firms, whether in high risk or not, are still reliant on the Paycheck Protection Program and Main Street Lending Program. With these programs’ benefits expiring soon, the federal government plans to extend an economic hand.</p>
