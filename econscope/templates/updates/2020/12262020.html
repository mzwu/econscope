        <p class="lead"> Congress is planning to pass a $900 billion coronavirus federal stimulus bill, which incorporates aid for businesses and households and funding for vaccine distribution.  </p>

          <p>Households and workers will receive a second round of direct stimulus payments, amounting to $166 billion of the bill. These payments consist of $600 for each adult and $600 for each dependent determined by their income in 2019. The bill will also offer a $300 weekly federal jobless subsidy for those who don’t normally qualify for unemployment benefits and $100 weekly subsidies for those whose unemployment benefits don’t consider their self-employment income, totaling to $120 billion. Additionally, the time period for which workers can request state and federal program benefits will be extended to 50 weeks from the original 26 weeks. The bill will allot $9 billion for healthcare providers, $4.5 for mental health, more than $1 billion for COVID-19 research, $82 billion for public and private K-12 schools, and $69 billion for COVID-19 vaccines, testing, and tracing. The bill will also provide $325 billion in federal aid to small businesses, as well as $125 billion to various sectors including transportation, nutrition, rental assistance, child care, and small banks.</p>

          <p>Congress passed the $900 billion coronavirus federal stimulus bill on December 21, 2021, with a 92-6 Senate vote and 359-53 House of Representatives vote. The bill now needs to be signed by President Trump to be taken into effect. As a result of this bill, economists expect greater economic recovery in the second half of 2021, since it’s too soon to determine any possible immediate effects for this winter season. Therefore, economic forecasts for 2021 have changed to reflect a more positive outlook due to high hopes for this next stimulus bill. Capital Economics projects a 5.5% expansion in U.S. GDP in 2021, as compared to its previous forecast of 5.5% growth. Oxford Economics stated that the additional governmental spending would increase U.S. GDP by 1%, totaling 4.5%. Another economist commented that household spending would actually make the largest impact on economic recovery, which will be boosted by additional weekly unemployment benefits and direct stimulus payments to households.</p>

          <p>When Congress sent the newly proposed COVID-19 federal stimulus bill to President Trump, expecting him to sign it into law, he condemned the bill, labeling the bill as having “almost nothing to do with COVID.” He tweeted a video calling for an increase in direct households payments from $600 to $2000, or $4000 for couples. Congress now has two options: pass new legislation that meets the president’s requests or override his veto with a two-thirds majority vote from both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The former would likely delay the overall timeline for federal stimulus, making Americans wait for extended periods of time to receive monetary aid. If President Trump doesn’t sign the bill or get his veto overridden by December 28, there is a possibility of a short government shutdown. If President Trump doesn’t sign or veto the bill by 10 days after the bill is passed, the bill will take effect.</p>

          <p>After President Trump called for officials to increase direct household payments from $600 to $2000 weekly in the newly proposed federal stimulus bill, Democrats attempted to pass higher weekly payments, but Republicans blocked their effort. Republicans then tried to cut foreign aid, but Democrats blocked this pass in turn. President Trumps’ request for higher payments does not align with the Republican lawmakers, many of which are not willing to raise payments higher than the previously agreed upon $600. If President Trump decides to veto the bill, the previous House and Senate votes suggest that there would be enough support to override his veto. However, some Republican officials may be inclined to change their position in light of President Trump’s newly surfaced criticisms.</p>

          <p>The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides federal monetary assistance to self-employed, gig workers, and others that don’t normally qualify for unemployment aid, and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, which provides additional assistance to people who have exhausted regular state unemployment benefits will end on December 26. Unless President Trump approves and signs the $900 billion federal stimulus bill, extra weekly unemployment benefits will not go into effect. Over 22 million jobs were lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic, just over half of which have been recovered as of November 2020. The two aforementioned unemployment benefit programs had provided aid to 14 million of the 20 million unemployment claims filed in the week that ended on December 5. According to the Brookings Institution, nearly 10 million people will lose their unemployment benefits on December 26. State unemployment assistance programs are unharmed, but many have lost eligibility for these programs.</p>
