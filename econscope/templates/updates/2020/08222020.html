        <p class="lead">  Food insecurity has proven to be a rising problem in the U.S., shown by a growing number of people who cannot afford enough food for themselves or their children.  </p>

          <p>Especially now that unemployment benefits have expired and been reduced, the figure is likely to grow in the coming months. The U.S. Census Bureau survey conducted in late July reported that 12.1% of adults did not have enough to eat at some point in the past seven days, as compared to 9.8% in early May, and 20% of adults with children could not afford to provide their children with enough to eat, as compared to 17% in early June. Consequently, food banks experienced higher demand over the course of the pandemic and the number of people receiving food stamps increased 16% between March and April. To combat this rising food insecurity, programs such as the Salvation Army in Washington, D.C. are providing canned and nonperishable goods to support Americans in need.</p>

          <p>Discussion between Republicans and Democrats over the next federal stimulus bill remains stalled, as stated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Democrats are pushing for a $2 trillion stimulus bill, but the Trump administration has currently set the bill amount to $1 trillion. However, after taking into account the several devastating economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the administration has expressed its willingness to increase the amount from $1 trillion. Both sides are making efforts to compromise and find a balance between aiding the U.S. economy and being conscious of federal funds. The negotiations could resume when the House of Representatives reconvenes to discuss legislation surrounding the U.S. Postal Service and the upcoming presidential election.</p>

          <p>Many states have received approval for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to issue an extra $300 a week in unemployment benefits. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin expects most U.S. states to be eligible to apply for these enhanced benefits. In order to be eligible, state unemployment agencies must be able to identify whether a person lost work due to the COVID-19 pandemic and must limit the extra aid to only those who currently receive at least $100 in weekly unemployment benefits. The deadline for states to apply to FEMA is September 10, 2020, in order to receive the extra unemployment benefits. However, many states are unsure of when they will be able to send out the monetary aid; Labor Department estimates show that the time it takes for money to reach Americans will average around three weeks. The number of initial unemployment claims for the week ending on August 15 rose to 1.1 million from a five-month low of 963,000 the week before. According to the Labor Department, the total number of people receiving unemployment benefits from state programs fell to 14.8 million last week. Although employers have added more than 9 million jobs to the labor market since the peak of unemployment claims in March, more than half of the 22 million jobs lost remain unrecovered. At this time, rehiring is slowing down, causing those who are unemployed to be more likely to suffer unemployment for a longer period of time.</p>

          <p>The U.S. composite purchasing managers output index (PMI) increased from 50.3 in July 2020 to 54.7 in August 2020. The U.K. composite PMI also increased from 57 to 60.3, but the eurozone’s composite PMI fell from 54.9 to 51.6 in contrast. Furthermore, Japan’s composite PMI stayed constant at 44.9 between July and August. The U.S. displayed the most economic expansion in comparison to other parts of the world, suggesting stimulated demand and resilience of businesses as COVID-19 cases continue to rise.</p>
