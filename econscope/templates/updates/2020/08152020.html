        <p class="lead">  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the U.S. federal budget gap for July 2020 was $61 billion, as compared to $120 billion in July 2019.  </p>

          <p>A likely cause for the narrowed budget gap is that households and businesses got around to paying tax payments, the deadline for which the Internal Revenue Service pushed back from the original April 15 deadline in order to aid Americans financially. Tax receipts in July 2020 totaled to $563 billion, which was greater than the July 2019 total of $312 billion yet still 10% less than the measures of April and June of 2019. Furthermore, for the first 10 months of the 2020 fiscal year, the federal budget deficit was 47% larger, revenues were 1% lower, and outlays were 51% higher than in the same period during the previous fiscal year. These statistics regarding the U.S. federal budget indicate that the nation has experienced a significant economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>President Trump wants employers to stop withholding the 6.2% Social Security tax on wages for employees making less than $100,000 annually, which will be in effect starting September 1 and lasting through December 31 of 2020. This could prove to be troublesome for employers as there would be no guarantee for Congress to forgive the deferral. Although this action would increase household wealth temporarily, the tax payments will have to be due at some point in the future. Other criticism highlights the fact that hiring is not encouraged and could destabilize Social Security funding. If this tax deferral is optional, employers are burdened with the choice of withholding, both options of which come with their own risks.</p>

          <p> The consumer price index (CPI) rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in July as demand for goods such as fuel, clothing, and electricity increased. The increase was higher than the 0.3% increase that economists expected. Gasoline prices increased 5.6% and vehicle prices rose 2.3%, yet grocery prices fell 0.4%. This was the second month in a row that the CPI increased after experiencing declines in March, April, and May. In addition to the CPI, the producer price index (PPI) also rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in July. Although prices are increasing, inflation does not seem to be a serious issue in the long term. Increasing prices signals a more stimulated economy, and it is unlikely that inflation during this time will get out of hand, as said by Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James & Associates. U.S. household retail spending increased 1.2% in July, following an 8.4% increase in June and 18% in May. These figures show that spending at service stations, restaurants, stores, and online continue to grow despite rising COVID-19 cases across the country. However, the decrease in weekly unemployment benefits will likely cause many households to be more cautious in their spending habits. Additionally, many schools have transitioned to fully online teaching, so back-to-school shopping could be lower than years past.</p>

          <p>Nationwide unemployment claims in the week that ended with August 8 amounted to 963,000, the first time since March 2020 that the number has fallen below 1 million. A possible cause for this is the expiration of $600 weekly unemployment benefits which have been lowered to roughly $330 per week. This change has likely discouraged unemployed workers from seeking benefits, encouraging them to return into the workforce. However, a survey by Cornell University found that 31% of workers who have regained work after being laid off have been laid off an additional time. Although these figures are concerning, other evidence suggests that the labor market is healing, as 1.8 million jobs were added in July, marking three consecutive months of job increases.</p>
