        <p class="lead">  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin’s decision not to renew five Federal Reserve emergency lending programs instigated partisan disagreement.  </p>

        <p>Mnuchin said that the programs were no longer necessary and that the more than $400 billion in unused funds would be put to better use elsewhere. He reasoned that he did not have the authority to extend these programs, but other officials counter this argument with the idea of a political motive. The Federal Reserve wanted the lending programs to be in effect until the major effects of the COVID-19 pandemic had been eliminated, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell even stated that it would be “premature to be pulling back support for the economy.” Discussions surrounding another round of federal stimulus for the pandemic have risen once again, as lawmakers have proposed $900 billion in lending funds to reach a compromise between the Democratic and Republican stances. Mr. Powell has been vocal in urging for more fiscal support to help the economy recover.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has extended four backstop lending programs until March of 2021 upon approval from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Earlier this month, the Treasury said that it would not renew five lending programs that backstopped the corporate and municipal debt markets and purchase loans for small businesses and nonprofit organizations after the programs’ expiration dates of December 31, 2020. Instead, the extensions made by the Federal Reserve on November 30, 2020, are targeted toward backstop lending programs that stabilized short-term funding markets. The first of the four extended programs is the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, which incentivized small banks to fund loans for the Paycheck Protection Program. Secondly, the Federal Reserve extended the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, which facilitated a smoother commercial paper market and decreased investment risk. The Federal Reserve also extended the Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility, which called upon financial institutions to purchase assets from money market mutual funds, and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, which allowed primary dealers to pledge a wider range of collateral to the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>President elect Joe Biden is about to inherit a fragile economy weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic; he was put in a similar situation more than a decade before when he took the position of Vice President in 2009 after the 2008 financial crisis. On a positive note, it seems that a COVID-19 vaccine will soon be approved. However, not many tools are left unused in an effort to help the economy recover; monetary policy and fiscal policy have been used to great extents already. Economist Janet Yellen has emerged as a Treasury secretary candidate. She was the previous Federal Reserve chair and has spent a large portion of her career balancing unemployment and inflation levels. She recently stated that it is imperative to take action to help the economy as soon as possible to prevent further damage. Although the current state of the economy is comparatively better than immediately following the 2008 financial crisis, there are less financial tools that the next administration can use to make a large economic impact.</p>

          <p>Initial weekly unemployment claims fell in the week that ended on November 28 to 0.712 million, marking a 75,000 drop from the week prior. The figure is only 1,000 above the lowest weekly jobless claim count seen during the COVID-19 pandemic but remains significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Economists say that last week’s drop could have been an anomaly due to Thanksgiving, as holidays tend to disrupt states’ claim processing. Recently, a government watchdog claimed that the unemployment data had major flaws, placing the validity of weeks of data into question. Especially as we enter deeper into the holiday season, economists are becoming increasingly wary of relying too heavily on reported data. In November, U.S. employers added 245,000 jobs, which was less than half of the amount of jobs added in October. Although the unemployment rate fell from 6.9% in October to 6.7% in November, this could be a misleading drop since more people stopped seeking work and were therefore taken out of the labor force when calculating the unemployment rate. As of now, the labor market has regained 12 million of the 22 million jobs lost in total due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of temporary layoffs decreased in November, but the number of long-term unemployed rose to 3.9 million, which was a 385,000 increase from the previous month. Those that are long-term unemployed now comprise 36.9% of the total unemployed population.</p>
