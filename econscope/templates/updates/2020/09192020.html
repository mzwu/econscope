        <p class="lead">  Central bankers don’t tend to get politically involved when making decisions.  </p>

        <p>However, in light of the continuing harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has voiced his opinion that Congress must do more to compensate for income losses and revenue holes. Although around 12 million laid off workers have been rehired since the height of the pandemic, around 2 million Americans seem to have permanently lost their jobs. The Federal Reserve, unwilling to cut interest rates below zero, seems to have exhausted their power and has turned their attention to Congress in terms of fiscal action.</p>

          <p>All 17 Federal Reserve officials state no plans to raise interest rates through the next year, and 13 officials projected keeping interest rates near zero through the year 2023. The Federal Reserve’s criteria for raising interest rates include when “labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time.” Officials believe that inflation will have only begun reaching 2% and that unemployment levels will have only begun approaching pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2023.</p>

          <p>In the week that ended on September 12, weekly unemployment claims decreased by 33,000 to a seasonally adjusted 860,000. Though this figure is the lowest in nearly six months, the number of weekly initial unemployment claims remains significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program has reported to pay approximately 14.5 million workers, which some economists believe to be an overestimate. Andrew Stettner from the Century Foundation believes that the true number lies around 10 million, the error of which is likely due to the fast setup of the program. Wayne Vroman from the Urban Institute claims that the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program is also more susceptible to fraud, since information such as income is self reported by self-employed workers. The Northeast and West regions of the U.S. have higher unemployment rates than the national average, whereas the Midwest and South regions of the U.S. have lower unemployment rates than the national average. Counterintuitively, the Midwest and South regions saw more COVID-19 outbreaks throughout the summer. In states that rely heavily on tourism, such as Hawaii and Nevada, unemployment levels have dropped significantly but still remain around 4% higher than the national average.</p>

          <p>American income statistics for 2019 were released by the Census Bureau on September 15, 2020. In 2019, the U.S. median household income was $68,700, marking a 6.8% increase from the prior year, and the poverty rate was 10.3%, which was 1.3% less than the prior year. Figures show that median household income increased for white, Black, Asian, and Hispanic households. Furthermore, the mean income for the lowest quintile of households rose 9% in 2019. However, income disparity continues to be highly prevalent, as the top fifth of households earn 51.9% of U.S. income, while the lowest fifth of households earn 3.1% of all income. The current COVID-19 pandemic not only marks the end of a decade-long expansion but will also likely exacerbate the discrepancies between lower income and higher income.</p>
