        <p class="lead">  The National Bureau of Economic Research officially declared that the U.S. entered a recession in February 2020, ending the expansion that started in June 2009. </p>

          <p>Economists and policy makers are not in agreement over the duration of the recession. In a Wall Street Journal survey, 68.4% of economists expect the U.S. to start on the path to economic recovery in the third quarter of this year. Economists also predict gross domestic product to contract 5.9% this year and the unemployment rate to fall to 9.6% by December of 2020. More than two-thirds of economists surveyed expect a “swoosh”-shaped recovery, marked by a drastic drop followed by a gradual recovery. So far, Congress has already spent $3.3 trillion in emergency stimulus packages and tax breaks. Because of this, however, the U.S. federal budget more than doubled in May and reached almost $2 trillion for this fiscal year. Federal spending increased by 53% due to economic relief spending. On the other hand, federal revenue decreased by 25%, reflecting the drop in employment, payroll, and income taxes.</p>

          <p>Next month, Congress is likely going to consider a second round of stimulus payments to provide further economic relief. These payments would consist of larger dollar amounts and will attempt to extend benefits to groups such as college students, adult dependents, and households with undocumented immigrants. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve plans to keep interest rates near zero by investing in Treasury securities to allow yields to remain at low levels. The last time the Federal Reserve capped yields was during World War II in 1951. The Fed needs to use forward guidance to regulate their bond purchases and long-term goals which has the potential to stimulate demand. Yield caps could prevent any sudden rise in Treasury yields due, act against pressures to raise interest rates, and solidify the commitment to keep interest rates low. Capping yields comes with its own risks: it could result in not as much stimulus since investors expect rates to remain low, and a premature end to the caps would cause the Federal Reserve’s credibility to suffer and lead to an unwanted increase in rates.</p>

          <p> Although U.S. employment rates are still known to be significantly high, the Labor Department reported that “misclassification errors” yielded lower unemployment rates than it would have been otherwise. Instead of a 13.3% unemployment rate in May, ridding of misclassification errors would have displayed a 16.3% rate. April’s unemployment rate would have been 19.7% instead of 14.7%, and March’s rate would have been higher as well. The misclassification error was rooted in those who self reported as “employed but absent from work” who should have been marked as unemployed. Even so, the amount of new weekly unemployment claims is decreasing, with 1.5 million new claims this past week. The extra $600 a week that jobless claimants are receiving due to the federal stimulus bill passed in March will expire at the end of July, arousing debate between political parties. Republicans believe that increasing the amount of benefits will reduce workers’ incentive to work, whereas Democrats are pushing for additional payments to provide financial stability to workers.</p>
