        <p class="lead">  Although factory activity rose in July for the U.S., the eurozone, and parts of Asia, the expected increase in economic activity was offset by weak global trade, indicated by a decreased amount of new export orders.  </p>

          <p>The U.S. and eurozone have each regained a purchasing managers index (PMI) of above 50 as of July (50.9 and 51.8, respectively) which signals manufacturing expansion. Since international demand is weak, governments of nations with export-reliant businesses must find a way to spur domestic demand. According to the World Trade Organization, global trade flows will decrease by at least 13% in the year 2020. Since international flight restrictions are still set in place, markets are having more difficulty finding, communicating with, and advertising to foreign consumers. The U.S. and other multinationals are exploring options to localize production, decreasing their reliance on production in foreign countries such as China. A number of Asian countries are on track to recover from manufacturing hits but are not quite at the rate of expansion. In July, South Korea reported a PMI of 46.9 and Japan reported a PMI of 45.2, both marking increases from the month prior but still indicate manufacturing contractions.</p>

          <p>According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Black-owned businesses were reported to be especially hard hit by the pandemic due to a multitude of factors, including geography, less accessibility to government aid programs, and weaker ties to banks. By studying why there were less active Black businesses than other racial groups between February and April of 2020, a study found that “higher concentrations of Black businesses are more likely to be facing larger direct (longer forced closures, Covid-19 symptoms) and indirect (social distancing, fewer customers) effects of the pandemic.” Moreover, areas with high concentration of Black-owned businesses received lower volumes of Paycheck Protection Program loans. The report suggests that future aid programs target specific locations to provide stimulus where it is needed most.</p>

          <p>The $600 weekly unemployment benefits expired last week, leaving many economists to predict a lapse in household spending as a result. Democrats and Republicans across the board generally agree that continuing unemployment benefits is essential for the livelihood of U.S. citizens, but the parties are in argument on how to do so. Republicans believe that the weekly benefits amount should be reduced to $200, stating that the $600-per-week rate discourages the unemployed to seek work. However, Democrats insist that $600 a week is necessary for households to stay afloat during this uncertain time. According to Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi, 1.1 million additional jobs could be lost if unemployment benefit payments are discontinued.</p>

          <p>The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 10.2% in July, and 1.8 million jobs were also added last month. Unemployment for white, Asian, and Hispanic workers decreased in July, but the rate for Black workers remained steady. Currently, there are 13 million less jobs than there were in February, right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S, showing that about half of U.S. jobs lost due to the pandemic are yet to be restored. Jobs in the service sector, such as leisure, hospitality, and retail, comprised most of the employment increase in the past two months, as the leisure and hospitality industry underwent a 19.9% job increase in June and a 4.96% job increase in July. Furthermore, total nonfarm payrolls increased to 139.582 million in July from a nadir of 130.303 in April. However, the Labor Department reported that the number of people who were unemployed for 15 to 26 weeks in July was triple that of June. These new findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic could have a greater long-term impact than previously anticipated. Because it is harder to regain work the longer that one is laid off or unemployed, many Americans can find themselves under a significant amount of financial stress during this time.</p>
