        <p class="lead">  Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have produced a coronavirus vaccine with 90% effectiveness, lifting hopes for an economic recovery in the near future.  </p>

          <p>The partners have stated their goal to authorize their vaccine by the end of November. However, it could take several months for the vaccine to be administered to a sufficient percentage of the population to start easing restrictions across the nation. Because of this, unemployment and weak demand for on-site sectors will remain issues for at least the next several months. With the likelihood of a successful vaccine, the U.S. economy is projected to return to its pre-pandemic size in the year 2022. After the declaration of a successful vaccine, the main factor contributing to economic recovery will be how efficiently nations can administer the vaccine and deem it safe to congregate in large groups once again.</p>

          <p>The economy has performed better than expected during the third quarter, so it seems that the amount of federal stimulus necessary is less than expected by economists. Accordingly, economists have adjusted their economic forecastings for the near future. The expected unemployment rate by the end of 2020 has fallen from 7.8% to 6.7% and GDP contractions have decreased from 3.6% to 2.7%. Surveyed economists report a 38% probability that federal stimulus will be issued in the fourth quarter of 2021 61% likelihood that it will occur in the first quarter of 2021. The majority of economists felt that the total stimulus value should fall between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, 29% felt that the value should be less than $1 trillion, and 13% felt that a value between $2.1 trillion and $3 trillion would best satisfy the needs of our economy. Recent news of a possibly successful vaccine could also affect economists’ predictions of future economic activity and needs.</p>

        <p>The number of job openings posted in the U.S. so far in November averaged 10.842 million, which is within 2% of February’s average at 11.056 million. In contrast, the lowest average daily job posting volume was 5.99 million in May, which was only 46% of the volume recorded in February. These figures show that job openings are climbing back up to pre-pandemic levels. As of October, the U.S. economy had regained 12.1 million of the 22 million total lost jobs due to the pandemic. According to ZipRecruiter, the amount of job openings has been greater for goods-focused industries and weaker for the service sector. The number of average daily job postings for transportation and storage has increased by 255.8% since February, whereas tourism job postings have only increased by 86.7%.  Although job openings are showing signs of recovery, the amount of rehirings will have to increase significantly in order to foster a faster economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

        <p>President-elect Joe Biden aims to work for pay increases and greater diversity for federal workers and contractors. Even if the Senate does not flip toward Democratic control, Biden will still strive to undo changes made by the Trump administration that raised the bar for workers to receive worker protections and benefits. A major factor contributing to the health of the labor market in the next four years will be Biden’s choice for Secretary of Labor. The next presidential administration will begin with the disastrous effects accumulated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including high unemployment rates and an economic slowdown. It is reported that the Biden administration will push for extended unemployment benefits and extra support for local and state governments. Biden has also stated his desire to raise the minimum wage, possibly to as much as $15 an hour.</p>

        <p>According to the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, the Japanese government’s relief program for small and midsize businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic has entailed more than $250 billion lended by banks within half a year. These loans have zero interest, which allows business owners to invest heavily in loans. Compared to the U.S., Japan’s relief program is larger relative to the size of its economy. Japan is still extending loans, whereas the Paycheck Protection Program ended in August. Japan has had a long battle with deflation and recently established a goal to let inflation rates rise above 2% to allow prices to rise. Although millions of jobs were gained and prices stopped decreasing in recent recents, the Japanese economy never reached 2% inflation. Loan requirements are freeing up in Japan, since banks are allowing borrowers to outline their business plans after applying for the loan in an effort to minimize approval time. Some officials are worried that this will contribute to the rise of zombie companies that are too weak to compete but are kept afloat by banks, but others argue that zombie companies are no threat when the world is under a global pandemic.</p>
