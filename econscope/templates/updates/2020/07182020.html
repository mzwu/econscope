        <p class="lead">  The Federal Reserve and the Treasury have butted heads in disagreement over the terms of the $600 billion Main Street Lending Program.  </p>

          <p>The Main Street Lending Program helps to support businesses that are not small enough to be eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program, yet are not large corporations. The main point of conflict over the Main Street Lending Program is whether or not the government should increase its risk, as no loans have been bought through this program since the start of the program in March. While the Federal Reserve prefers relaxed terms that could potentially cause the government to lose money, the Treasury favors a safer, more conservative option. The process of creating new terms includes the Federal Reserve analyzing and proposing terms for the program, which the Treasury can then either accept, veto, or introduce new ideas. Officials from the Federal Reserve and Treasury are maintaining professionalism throughout this process, working together to learn and create the best possible outcome. Later that week, the Federal Reserve proposed extending its $600 billion Main Street Lending Program to nonprofits, schools, hospitals, and other service organizations. Eligible nonprofits include those that have at least 10 employees and as many as 15,000. Nonprofit applicants to the program must have at most $3 billion in endowments and have been in operation for the past five years. In addition, regarding the Small Business Administrationâ€™s Paycheck Protection Program, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin proposed forgiving all PPP loans under $150,000, essentially turning them into grants. This encompasses 86% of the PPP applications. Many officials agree with Mnuchin, expressing their support for small businesses across the U.S.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.6% in June, signaling a sharp rise in consumer prices as retail stores and businesses began to reopen. In contrast, the entire three month duration in March, April, and May experienced declines in CPI. Among the prices that increased include apparel, health care, airline fares, hotels, gasoline, groceries, and eating out. Economists worried that deflation would occur as a result of the drop in consumer demand, but the recent rise in prices has curbed those fears. U.S. industrial production, which measures output from factories, mines, and utilities, rose 5.4% in June. This is the second month in a row during which industrial production rose since the pandemic hit. Employers are rehiring across the U.S., but many have been hesitant considering safety concerns at work. Among the industrial industries, manufacturing increased by 7.2% and utilities increased by 4.2%, yet mining fell 2.9%. Additionally, U.S. retail sales also rose for the second month in a row as lockdown restrictions are gradually being lifted. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 7.5% during June. Between May and June, gasoline spending increased by 15.3% and revenue from bars and restaurants increased by 20%. However, an expected surge in COVID-19 cases could yield lower demand and possibly suppress output, lower prices, and stall the recent rebound.</p>
