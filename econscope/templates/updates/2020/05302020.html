        <p class="lead"> The U.S. economy is starting back up again, with air travel and hotel bookings increasing. </p>

          <p>By May 22, the number of travelers passing through Transportation Security Administration security screening had tripled since April 14. Available loads for trucks have also increased by more than 20% from previous weeks. Due to the pandemic, consumer sentiment is at a low while stocks continue to rise. Consumer spending in April fell by 13.6%, a low in records since 1959. Personal income increased by 10.5% in April, largely due to government stimulus programs. Because of these uncertain times, personal saving rates increased from 8% in February to 13.1% in March. Whereas consumer sentiment surveys track the wellbeing of the economy more closely, the stock market is also influenced by other factors such as Federal Reserve policy. As shown by stock rebounds, stock investors seem to be expecting a V-shaped recovery.</p>

          <p> America’s youth is having trouble finding summer jobs, as the most common places for teens to find jobs - pools, restaurants, golf courses, and more - are shut down. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, teens aged 16 to 19 are experiencing a 32% unemployment rate, an unprecedented number in the past 50 years. Last week, 2.1 million people filed for unemployment benefits, aligning with the downward trend starting from late March. However, the number of jobless claims continues to be significantly higher than it was prior to the coronavirus pandemic. In contrast, the total number of unemployed could be offset by recent changes in recalls or new sources of employment.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has been reducing their purchases every week, going from $375 billion in late March to $25 billion this week. Moreover, investors do not expect interest rate increases for at least 3 years. Although the economy has experienced great improvement over the past couple months, the gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions could take a greater toll on the economy. One sixth of the Federal Reserve’s $1.3 billion of exchange-traded funds focused on buying non-investment grade debt. Some purchases had exposure to junk bonds, which some investors see as a risk for a deeper credit freeze while others see as a chance to reward firms. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, governments are quick to act against foreign investment and trade practices. Among the industries with the highest defense are technology, mining, and pharmaceuticals.</p>

          <p>The European Union plans to enact a €750 billion stimulus package to support its 27 members. Of the package, €500 billion will go toward recovery efforts and will not be counted in national debt. The remaining €250 billion will be allocated toward loans that countries need to apply for. On May 26, the People’s Bank of China set the daily midpoint for the yuan at 7.1293 per dollar, its weakest rate in the past 12 years. Historically, the yuan weakens as tensions between the U.S. and China heighten. Events that could weaken Chinese currency even more include trade wars and tech wars.</p>
