        <p class="lead">  According to the International Monetary Fund, debt across advanced economies has soared to 128% of global gross domestic product (GDP) as of July 2020.  </p>

          <p>In comparison, World War II debt in 1946 reached 124% of global GDP. It will be harder to rebound from this mounting debt in 2020, since there is not as much room for technological, population, and economic growth as there was during the post-WWII period. The U.S. currently holds $26 trillion in debt, $4 trillion of which is attributed to the Federal Reserve. This places a lot of strain and risks on the central bank, a problem which it will have to deal with for years, and even decades, to come. Although the piling debt results in increasing worry, lawmakers across the board generally agree that controlling the COVID-19 virus is a far more pressing issue.</p>

          <p>Even though the eurozone experienced a GDP contraction of 2.6% greater than the U.S., European unemployment has risen far less than the U.S. This discrepancy largely stems from different approaches to stimulating the labor market. In the eurozone, governments have taken action to pay companies billions of dollars to retain workers on payrolls. Although some workers might be working less hours than prior to the pandemic, the continent runs short-time work programs which reimburses workers who are working, and therefore earning, less than before. These short-time work programs helped to stimulate businesses and keep citizens in the labor market, preventing unemployment. In contrast, most U.S. stimulus went directly to those who were unemployed through weekly unemployment benefits. Ultimately, there are benefits and risks for each situation.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer spending increased more slowly in July than in previous months, with personal consumption expenditures rising by 1.9% as compared to 6.2% in June and 8.6% in May. August consumer spending data will likely show a further decrease due to the expiration of $600 weekly unemployment benefits. Consumer spending is an integral part of the economy, which has been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the Commerce Department reported a nationwide personal income increase of 0.4% in July, interest rate cuts continue to be detrimental to personal savings. Additionally, U.S. home price growth held steady in June 2020, as indicated by the unchanged measure of 4.3% from the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index between May and June. Demand for homes has increased as pandemic-induced lockdowns are lifted and near-zero interest rates seem to stay for the long term. On the other hand, sales of previously owned homes surged 20% in June and 25% in July, suggesting shortages of such housing across the U.S.</p>

          <p>Initial unemployment claims in the week that ended with August 22 decreased slightly to a little over 1 million. Unemployment is falling gradually, but the U.S. economy and labor market still has a long road to recovery. The amount of those receiving unemployment benefits continues to fall, partially due to the expiration of $600 weekly benefits and implementation of $300 weekly benefits administered by states. Because of this major shift, figures show that Americans are cutting back spending on groceries and grocery stores are even bringing back discounts. Many have been put under a significant amount of financial stress and insecurity throughout this recession, which has been exacerbated by the cut in weekly financial aid.</p>
