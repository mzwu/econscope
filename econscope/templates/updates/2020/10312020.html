        <p class="lead">  Upon hearing of or experiencing the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers across the globe sharply increased their savings.  </p>

          <p>This decision occurred due to a plethora of reasons: business shutdowns, virus concerns, working from home, and layoffs. Now, the fate of global economic recovery from the COVID-19 induced recession lies in the hands of consumers. If consumers are willing to increase spending in the nearing weeks and subsequently raise demand, then international economies could possibly be better off and experience strong recovery and even growth. In the U.S., the personal saving rate reached a historically high 33.6% in April 2020, but decreased to 14.1% in August 2020. These figures demonstrate that U.S. consumers are gradually spending more, even if the personal saving rate is still significantly higher than before the pandemic. However, other countries are seeing continuously high levels of saving. This would place a pause on short-term economic recovery but could potentially prove to be more beneficial for long-term economic recovery. Government officials are near powerless in this situation, as they can encourage spending but cannot enforce it.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy recovered around two-thirds of its damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, growing at a record rate of 7.4% in the third quarter and at a 33.1% annual rate. GDP experienced a record quarterly growth in more than seven decades, totaling $18.58 trillion at the end of the third quarter of 2020. This growth is largely due to increased consumer spending, business investment, and government spending during the past quarter. According to the figures reported by the Commerce Department, the economy is currently 3.5% smaller than at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. Projections for the fourth quarter are not as optimistic as the third quarter, as economists predict that economic expansion will slow down and unemployment will remain at high levels during the winter season. Despite this, many economists still expect the economy to grow throughout 2021.</p>

          <p>Paying rent has surfaced as an ever-increasing problem that business owners have been facing since March, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S. Businesses across the nation have been forced to shut down or close temporarily, placing business owners and renters into a tough financial situation. A U.S. Census survey conducted in September 2020 displays that the largest percentage of tenant households behind on rent payments belong to Black renters, followed by Asians, Hispanics, Whites, then other races. According to the survey, women are also more likely than men to owe debt. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that outstanding rent debt is expected to reach $7.2 billion by the end of 2020. In addition, Moody Analytics calculated that, without extra federal stimulus, 12.8 million Americans would have an average debt of $5400. The economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic clearly exacerbate the disparities between those of lower and higher socioeconomic statuses, as lower classes are more likely to experience severe financial setbacks than their higher class counterparts.</p>

          <p>President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on steel imports to support domestic American steel producers. Consequently, steel imports decreased and the price of domestic steel increased. However, the tariffs did not result in the rapid growth and immense job opportunities that President Trump had expected. Furthermore, other sectors such as automotive and appliances were even harmed by the rising steel prices. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, steel consumption in the U.S. remained mostly uniform after its peak in the year 2014. Additionally, buyers of steel have experienced hardships that forced them to lay off thousands of American workers. The steel tariff also spurred retaliatory tariffs made by foreign countries, including the European Unionâ€™s 31% tariff on bikes made in the U.S.</p>
