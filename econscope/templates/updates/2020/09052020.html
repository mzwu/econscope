        <p class="lead">  After implementing many programs and economic stimulus actions, the Federal Reserve plans to focus on asset purchases and policy plan guidance going forward regarding aiding the economy to recovery due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>

          <p>These two tools were used after cutting interest rates near zero during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. They will effectively seek periods of higher inflation to compensate for the lack thereof in past months. By doing so, this policy will hopefully raise expectations of future inflation by businesses and investors, encouraging smoother market functioning. However, officials and economists are worried that these tools will not be as effective since interest rates will remain low for the foreseeable future. Even with extensive federal action, the plan may not prove to be as effective as it would have been a few decades ago.</p>

        <p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress to pass more funding for the next coronavirus relief bill. In recent news, Democrats have generally advocated for greater economic stimulus while Republicans are generally more conservative with federal funds. Considering Democrats’ proposal of $3.5 trillion and Republicans’ proposal of $1 trillion, Secretary Mnuchin proposed a compromise of $1.5 trillion. However, tensions continue as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reports that Democrats are unwilling to accept any amount less than $2.2 trillion. Despite their differences, Democrats and Republicans across the board agree that funds must be directed to support small businesses, unemployment benefits, and households.</p>

        <p>Weekly unemployment claims in the week that ended on August 29 yielded a seasonally adjusted measure of 881,000. In contrast, the number of applicants to state benefit programs increased for the second week in a row. State-funded support assists gig workers, self employed workers, and workers with special circumstances such as inability to report to work due to lack of child care. The number of people receiving continued jobless benefits decreased nearly 1.3 million between August 15 and August 22. Regarding the additional $300 weekly unemployment benefits that President Trump signed off last month, the Labor Department estimates that the payments will take roughly 3 weeks to be distributed. Workers across the country are feeling pressure to return to work despite the health risks, as bills need to be paid. In August, 1.4 million jobs were added and the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%. Although less than the year’s high of nearly 15% in April, the August unemployment rate remains significantly higher than 3.5% at the month prior to the pandemic. Additionally, even though total nonfarm payrolls have been increasing since May, the U.S. still has 11.5 million jobs less than in February of 2020.</p>

        <p>According to the August 2020 purchasing managers indexes (PMI) for manufacturing, China and Germany are leading manufacturing activity at levels of 53.1 and 52.2, respectively. While these two countries’ PMI are increasing, other countries with rising infection rates are experiencing declines in PMI, namely Spain, Vietnam and the Philippines. Although China and Germany are seeing a rise in manufacturing activity, they are still undergoing job cuts in the manufacturing industry. The only countries experiencing an increase in manufacturing jobs are Myanmar and Turkey. Many governments fear that long-term job loss could hinder consumer spending power and confidence, lengthening the time needed to recover from the pandemic.</p>
