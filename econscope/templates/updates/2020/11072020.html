        <p class="lead">  U.S. exports rose in September, narrowing the trade deficit from $67.04 billion in August to $63.86 a month later.  </p>

          <p>This figure is still much higher than the reported trade deficit of $47.84 from a year earlier. In September, exports rose 2.6%, while imports rose 0.5%, marking the slowest growth rate since earlier this year in May. Economists generally agreed in an interview that the U.S. was experiencing a much faster recovery rate than expected with regards to trade. Their pessimistic expectations were likely the result of mass lockdowns across the nation and vast spending by Congress. However, recent reports of consumer spending add on to the gloomy recovery outlook. The growth rate of consumer spending has slowed in September after rising for five months in a row. Likewise, U.S. spending on foreign consumer goods declined 3.6% in August after rising for a consecutive four months.</p>

          <p>For the week that ended on October 31, weekly initial unemployment claims dropped to 751,000, which was only 7,000 less than the week prior. So far, this has been the lowest figure since mid-March, but is still substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels. More than half of the 22 million lost jobs have been regained, but momentum of job growth has slowed in recent months. September yielded 661,000 new jobs, which was less than half of the 1.5 million regained jobs in August. October’s official figures have not been reported yet, but economists expect that 530,000 were added in October. They also expect the unemployment rate to decline from 7.9% in September to 7.7% in October. Job regrowth and unemployment recovery has shown signs of slowing, especially as layoffs are expecting to become more long-term.</p>

          <p>In early August of 2020, the Treasury estimated that it would borrow $1.216 trillion during the final quarter of the year. However, the Treasury has altered its estimate and now predicts a total borrowing amount of $617 billion during the fourth quarter. Discussions over the next proposed stimulus bill remain stalled, but Congress will eventually pass a stimulus bill worth roughly $2 trillion. With government spending pushed back, it is likely that much of the borrowing will be delayed into early 2021. In the end, U.S. government spending during the second half of 2020 will turn out to be $1.1 trillion less than the first half of the year, as borrowing from January to March totaled $1.127 trillion while spending from July to September reached only $454 billion. Additionally, Congress has called for $3.6 trillion in spending since March to combat the economic downfalls brought by the COVID-19 pandemic including mass unemployment and business closures. High spending and low revenues have deepened the magnitude of deficits, which many have labeled as unsustainable.</p>

          <p>The manufacturing sector in Asia and Europe rebounded in October, shown by international jumps in purchasing managers indices for manufacturing. Manufacturers are rehiring workers as consumer demand jumps and calls for more production. Across Asia and Europe, countries are reporting elevated employment as factories rehire after months of job cuts and layoffs. Factories in India, Thailand, and South Korea are reporting the greatest rise in activity since the start of the pandemic. Additionally, factories in Germany saw a great increase in export orders. The eurozone’s manufacturing purchasing managers index rose from 53.7 in September to 54.8 in October, marking a record index in the past 27 months. According to France’s statistics agency, household consumption of manufactured goods increased 4.2% in the past year, but household consumption of services fell 5%. This indicates the shift of consumer spending from services to manufactured goods. Despite recent boosts in the global economy, the final quarter of 2020 is not projected to be as promising for manufacturing, since more restrictions are being put in place to limit the spread of COVID-19.</p>
