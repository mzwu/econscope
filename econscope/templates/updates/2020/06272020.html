        <p class="lead">  U.S. jobless claims in the past week measured a historically high 1.5 million, remaining steady for the past three weeks. </p>

          <p>Economists have observed that while layoffs are slowing, the pace of rehiring is not enough to compensate for job losses. These incoming statistics are feeding into discussion about whether or not the federal government should extend unemployment benefits. According to the Brookings Institution, states with greater unemployment benefits are experiencing faster recoveries through more rehirings and less layoffs. In contrast, the Congressional Budget Office warned that the increase in benefits would cause employment to decline in the coming years. According to federal law, private employers can reject a job applicant due to a past file of bankruptcy, information which they can find through directly asking or a credit check. Some believe that this practice is fair and is done only in the best interest of the business, but others do not think that a past bankruptcy file should determine an applicant’s strength or ability. Especially due to the effects of this year’s Covid-19 pandemic on employment and small businesses, more consumer advocates are pushing for a change in law to encourage re-entry into the job market. In addition, female employment has declined at a steeper rate than male employment due to the fact that women make up a large section of workers in service-sector jobs, which have suffered from state lockdowns and social distancing measures. Increasing female unemployment can have undesirable impacts on economic growth, as female-dominated occupations such as nursing and health care endure losses. The labor force participation rate, including those either working or actively seeking jobs, of females aged 25 to 54 dropped from 77% in February to 74.3% in May. In contrast, the labor force participation rate of prime-aged men contracted from 89.3% in February to 87.2% in May.</p>

          <p>The pandemic will no doubt take a toll on global trade. Governments around the world are attempting to relocate manufacturing sites to their own land. Many governments have curbed exports to reserve resources for their own people. However, placing barriers to commerce could result in rising costs and slowing growth. Low-income countries are especially susceptible to “prolonged damage to global supply chains, global trade and financial flows, and global collaboration,” as stated by the World Bank. Economists project that foreign trade will decrease by nearly 33%, and foreign direct investment by an even larger percentage. In the U.S., stress tests for banks display that U.S. banks have enough strength to push through the economic downfalls that the Covid-19 pandemic brought. In order to remain resilient, banks must restrict dividend payouts to a maximum amount of their average quarterly profit from the past four quarters. Moreover, the Federal Reserve prohibited banks from buying back shares in the third quarter.</p>

          <p>Many countries have experienced a rebound in Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), including France’s increase from 32.1 in May to 51.3 in June, as well as Australia’s rise from 28.1 in May to 52.6. A PMI reading of above 50 indicates increasing economic activity. While certain countries are encountering signs of gradual recovery such as lesser amounts of payroll drops and order declines, others continue to see drops in service and manufacturing activity. Although other countries have not quite reached the threshold of 50, there is a general increasing trend which alludes to hopeful expansions in the future. Consumer spending in May increased by 8.2%, a historic high since 1959. Although the measure is still 12% less than in February, households are beginning to venture outside their homes for the first time in months. A concern that comes along with economic reopening is the possibility of a rise in Covid-19 infections.</p>
