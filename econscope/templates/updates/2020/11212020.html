        <p class="lead">  Even amidst the hopeful news of a successful vaccine to combat the COVID-19 virus, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the recent increase in COVID-19 cases still posed a significant challenge to the U.S. economy’s recovery.  </p>

          <p>The labor market, along with many other indicators of economic health, has only improved slightly. With the rise in COVID-19 cases, commercial activity is being hindered and people are losing confidence in the actions taken to control the pandemic. Chairman Powell said that the Federal Reserve would continue utilizing their resources to boost the economy and only retract them when “the job is well and truly done.”  Currently buying $120 billion in assets per month, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet around December 15-16 to discuss further action.</p>

        <p>The Federal Reserve’s index of industrial production for October 2020, which measures production at factories, mines and utilities, increased by a seasonally adjusted 1.1%. This increase followed a 0.4% decline in September, setting U.S. output at 5.6% lower than in February of this year. Manufacturing increased 1%, utility output rose 3.9%, and mining output fell 0.6%. Additionally, capacity utilization rose to 72.8% in October, demonstrating increased slack in the industrial economy. Retail sales also rose 0.3% between September and October, which has been the smallest monthly retail sales increase since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. In recent weeks, spending has increased for general merchandise, decreased for building materials and electronics, and remained roughly steady for health and personal care. Recent developments such as increased daily COVID-19 cases and the possibility of a verified vaccine in the next few months could prove to be impactful on these measurements.</p>

        <p>In the week that ended on November 14, 2020, jobless claims rose from the week prior to 742,000. Although significantly lower than the peak weekly initial unemployment claim amount in late March, the current jobless claim level is still three times higher than during pre-pandemic levels. On the other hand, the Labor Department reported that the number of unemployment benefit recipients through state benefit programs actually fell to 6.4 million in the week that ended on November 7 from the previous week. Some people have exhausted their benefits from state programs, so they are receiving 13 weeks of extended benefits from a federal benefit program. The number of people receiving benefits from the extended federal benefit program has increased in recent weeks, rising from 4.1 million in the week that ended on October 24 to 4.4 million a week later.</p>

        <p>China’s economy is increasingly expanding, setting the country on track for a more rapid economic recovery in the final quarter of 2020. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China’s industrial output surpassed expectations at a 6.9% growth rate during October, as compared to the projected 6.5%. In addition, investment and consumer spending both rose at quick rates in October, as fixed-asset investment increased 1.8% from January to October. Retail sales rose 4.3% in October compared to the previous year, but was less than the projected 4.6%. Furthermore, China’s urban surveyed jobless rate fell from 5.4% in September to 5.3% in October. After experiencing an economic contraction due to the COVID-19 pandemic, China underwent expansions of 3.2% and 4.9% in the second and third quarters, respectively. China’s economy is forecasted to expand by 2% in 2020, setting the record as the only economy in the globe to expand after being hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
