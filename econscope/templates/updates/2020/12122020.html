        <p class="lead"> A part of Joe Biden’s presidential campaign consisted of forgiving billions of dollars in student loans, which reign as the second highest source of debt for American citizens, following mortgage debts.   </p>

        <p>Other officials and activists are pushing for even greater forgiveness, with goals of up to $1.6 trillion of debt forgiveness. Considering current circumstances, economists believe that debt forgiveness could boost the U.S. economy by encouraging consumer spending and business investment. Biden is starting with a $10,000 write-off for millions of Americans under federal debt. He has also proposed additional debt forgiveness for low-income families and the possibility of free college tuition to families making less than $125,000 annually. Republicans are reluctant to give a free pass on this debt and have also brought up the point that debt forgiveness can disproportionately aid those of higher income, which counteracts the main purpose of the write-offs. Past research supports these concerns, but also suggests that debt forgiveness can still provide substantial help for lower-income families. </p>

        <p>Due to the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, the United States as well as countries in Europe spurred greater demand for healthcare supplies from China. Therefore, economists expect that China’s exports grew in November, which is supported by the increase in China’s purchasing managers index from October to November. These expectations suggest that factory activity is thriving and growing in China. Additionally, the European Central Bank is planning to provide additional stimulus as its economy is suffering under tighter restrictions in order to curb COVID-19 cases. Their next stimulus package will likely include more bond purchases, a decrease in interest rates, and an incentive for banks to loan. As the public and private sector is adjusting to the recent increase in COVID-19 cases, economists expect that the United Kingdom’s GDP could have fallen in October. In the U.S., weekly unemployment claims are expected to rise in the most recent week due to effects from the Thanksgiving holiday, and consumer prices are expected to increase slightly.</p>

        <p>Job growth figures from November 2020 signal a slow in economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of average job postings in November decreased to 10.7 million from 10.9 million in October. This figure was still less than the over 11 million people still unemployed in the U.S. The Labor Department also reported that employers only added 245,000 jobs in November compared to the 610,000 increase reported in October. In addition, the number of LinkedIn users sharing a new employer increased by only 0.8% between October and November, which was significantly less than the 18.1% increase from September to October. The labor market is suffering from a variety of factors, including less federal support to households, recent surges in COVID-19 cases, and newly enforced restrictions that hinder business and households activity. Previous news of a possible COVID-19 vaccine lifted confidence in economic growth and recovery, but it has been set back by ever-increasing COVID-19 case reports.</p>

        <p>The most recent Wall Street Journal survey demonstrated that economists no longer expect substantial economic growth or labor market recovery in the first quarter of 2021. This new opinion was formed on the basis that the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to take longer than originally anticipated. The approval process coupled with a possibly lengthy distribution time have pushed back the date for social and economic reopenings across the nation. Now, economists expect a 1.3% economic expansion from January to March of 2021, which was 1.4% less than expectations in the November survey. Additionally, economists expect for 295,000 jobs to be created monthly from January to March, which was 145,000 less than the previously reported forecast. Despite these pessimistic expectations, most economists expect that the COVID-19 vaccine will lead to significant economic improvement in the second quarter of 2021.</p>

        <p>The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment surpassed economist expectations of 75.5 and instead reached 81.4 in early December from 76.9 in November. This report shows that consumers are growing to be more confident in the U.S. economy as news of a vaccine points to alleviation of economic restrictions. However, the recent figures could potentially be skewed by partisan views and the recent presidential election results. Economists and other officials say that Democrats could be more optimistic about the economy’s current and future state due to Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. COVID-19 cases are still rising rapidly, which offsets much of the general public’s positive outlook on the U.S.’s current economic situation.</p>
