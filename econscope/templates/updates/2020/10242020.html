        <p class="lead">  Many workers in the U.S. stopped actively searching for jobs in September 2020.  </p>

          <p>The data released by the Labor Department shows that the size of the labor force contracted in the majority of the states that experienced an unemployment rate decrease last month. Decreasing unemployment rates seem to hint at economic recovery across the U.S., but in actuality workers are giving up looking for work and are thus not counted in the unemployment rates. For example, New York’s unemployment rate fell 2.8% in September, which intuitively relates to greater rehiring, but 300,000 workers actually came off unemployment rolls that month. These workers exited the labor force and are no longer contributing to the state’s unemployment rate. Conversely, unemployment rates rose in states including Arizona and Utah, signaling that the number of people actively seeking work is increasing.</p>

          <p>The Labor Department reported that U.S. weekly initial unemployment claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 in the week that ended on October 17. The state of California has resumed processing jobless claims and reporting the actual number of unemployment claims, which is reflected in the lower initial unemployment claim count reported for last week. As of the most recent week’s unemployment data, the amount of initial weekly jobless claims in the U.S. has remained under 1 million for 8 weeks now. Additionally, the number of recipients continuing to receive unemployment benefits was 8.373 million as of October 10, which was only a third of the peak amount in early May. According to a Wall Street Journal survey, most economists do not expect for the labor market to return to its pre-pandemic condition until at least the year 2023.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard expressed her concern that the U.S. economy would not experience a smooth recovery without substantial additional government stimulus to support the sectors that were hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the current K-shaped recovery path, disparities in the overall economy and labor market will be further exacerbated without federal stimulus. The lack of fiscal support, she says, will hold back unemployment and consumer spending, which will result in more long-term harm for suffering businesses and individuals experiencing unemployment. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy plan implemented in August outlines keeping interest rates near zero until inflation is expected to hit and exceed 2%. The federal bank is also purchasing $120 billion worth of securities each month, but Mrs. Brainard noted that officials would be meeting to discuss the duration of these monthly purchases.</p>

          <p>China’s GDP grew 4.9% in the third quarter of 2020 from the year prior. This advancement places China back on its pre-pandemic economic growth trajectory only 8 months after COVID-19’s devastating blow. The International Monetary Fund projected that China’s economy would expand a total of 1.9% in 2020, making it the only country to experience economic growth this year. The nation achieved this by shutting down economic activity in the first quarter, fostering factory recovery in the second quarter, and reviving consumer activity in the third quarter. China’s retail sales increased 3.3% in September, which was greater than the expected 1.7% increase. Chinese citizens’ disposable incomes also increased by 0.6% from the previous year. Additionally, China’s unemployment fell to 5.4% in September from 5.8% in August. Other large economies are facing economic contractions, including the United States’ forecast of a 4.3% contraction and the eurozone’s forecast of an 8.3% contraction.</p>

          <p>The purchasing managers index for the U.S. increased from 54.3 in September to 55.5 in October 2020. This figure marks the highest index that the U.S. has achieved in almost two years, as economic activity has been bolstered by expected greater demand from businesses. Furthermore, business confidence in service and manufacturing sectors have risen to its highest level in more than two years. Economists have predicted that the U.S. economy grew by 28.5% in the third quarter, which is a historically high rate of growth, but this still doesn’t compensate for the 31.4% decline experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. By contrast to the U.S.’s upward outlook, countries in Europe have recently seen surges in COVID-19 cases and have implemented new restrictions on business activity. The eurozone’s purchasing managers index fell to 49.4 in October from 50.4 in September, placing the region below the threshold of 50.</p>
