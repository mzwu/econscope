        <p class="lead"> In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the central bank slashed interest rates to near zero and launched various emergency lending and stimulus programs.  </p>

        <p>Starting in June, the Federal Reserve has been buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage bonds monthly. The Fed plans to continue these purchases until their employment and inflation goals have been met, which are not likely to be achieved for a few years. As of now, officials predict that unemployment will fall to 4% and inflation will reach 2% by the end of the year 2023. Even so, the Federal Reserve plans to keep interest rates near zero for years. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell commented that interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing, are performing well. By contrast, the struggling sectors are not suffering from high interest rates, but rather from exposure and vulnerability to the COVID-19 virus.</p>

          <p>The new coronavirus federal stimulus bill proposal consists of $908 billion, $300 billion of which will be directed to the Small Business Administration and a renewal of the Paycheck Protection Program which had expired in August 2020. New loans under this plan would be limited to small businesses with a maximum of 300 employees and proof that they have undergone a revenue loss of 30% in a quarter of this year. This is markedly different from the initial implementation of the PPP, as the requirements limited loans to businesses with 500 or fewer employees but there was evidence that larger companies received PPP loans. However, the PPP does not appeal to all industries. Specifically, restaurants are struggling with the program’s emphasis on payroll, which contributes to difficulties as most restaurants are not operating at full capacity and are therefore unable to match their pre-pandemic payroll levels. Due to this, the National Restaurant Association is even calling for an industry-specific fund to aid restaurants across the nation.</p>

          <p>U.S. industrial production rose 0.4% from October to November 2020. This increase was less than the 0.9% jump from the month before, but is still indicative of boosts in manufacturing and mining. Manufacturing output rose for the seventh month in a row, sustaining a 0.8% increase in November. Mining output increased by 2.3%, but still remains 12.5% down from a year prior. Additionally, utility output decreased by 4.3% in November. Industrial production reached its peak growth rate of 6.2% in June 2020, and the growth rate has slowed ever since. In more optimistic news, capacity utilization increased to 73.3% in November from 73.0% in October. Capacity utilization measures the percentage of potential industrial production that the nation is producing. Economists had originally forecasted a 73.0% capacity utilization in November, but the reported measure exceeded expectations.</p>

          <p>Total retail and restaurant sales in November amounted to $546.5 billion, which was a 1.1% drop from $552.48 billion in October. However, November 2020 retail and restaurant sales were still 4.1% greater than during this time last year. Retail sales had been climbing rapidly since April of this year, but started to decline slightly starting in October. November’s reported figures also contribute to the downward trend in retail sales. Even throughout Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which have historically yielded surges in retail activity, U.S. shoppers have spent 14% less than last year, averaging around $312 on holiday and gift-related purchases. As expected, online shopping increased dramatically while in-person shopping decreased significantly. Retail sales have continued to slow down since Thanksgiving, showing that consumers are not as eager to spend on holiday items this gift-giving season.</p>

          <p>Weekly initial unemployment claims rose to 885,000 in the week that ended on December 12, marking the second week in a row of increasing claims. Although this figure is immensely lower than the pandemic period’s record high of nearly 7 million jobless claims, the four-week moving average is starting to edge up after a lengthy downward trending period. The four-week moving average recognizes and smooths out week-to-week variability, so it is a more reliable measure of growth and decline trends in unemployment claims. Unemployment claims actually fell in many states last week, but rose substantially in states with newly imposed restrictions, such as California and Illinois. As of December 5, a little over 5.5 million people are recipients of continued unemployment benefits through regular state programs. This was less than the week prior, signaling that laid-off workers are being rehired and returning to work.</p>
