          <p class="lead">Congress passed the $900 billion coronavirus federal stimulus bill on December 21, 2021, with a 92-6 Senate vote and 359-53 House of Representatives vote. </p>
          <p>As a result of this bill, economists expect greater economic recovery in the second half of 2021, since it’s too soon to determine any possible immediate effects for this winter season. Therefore, economic forecasts for 2021 have changed to reflect a more positive outlook due to high hopes for this next stimulus bill. Capital Economics projects a 5.5% expansion in U.S. GDP in 2021, as compared to its previous forecast of 5.5% growth. Oxford Economics stated that the additional governmental spending would increase U.S. GDP by 1%, totaling 4.5%. Another economist commented that household spending would actually make the largest impact on economic recovery, which will be boosted by additional weekly unemployment benefits and direct stimulus payments to households.</p>
          <p><b>What the bill includes:</b></p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Individual stimulus payments ($166 billion):</b> $600 for each adult and child for individuals with incomes of up to $75,000 or couples with incomes of up to $150,000</li>
              <li><b>Unemployment aid ($120 billion):</b> $300 weekly federal jobless subsidy for those who don’t normally qualify for unemployment benefits and $100 weekly subsidies for those whose unemployment benefits don’t consider their self-employment income</li>
              <li><b>Rental assistance ($25 billion):</b> eligible tenants include those who make less than 80% of median income in their region, have at least one employed worker in the household, and have demonstrated risk of losing their home</li>
              <li><b>Child care ($10 billion):</b> grants for childcare providers and support for the Head Start program</li>
              <li><b>Public and private schools ($82 billion):</b> $54.3 billion is allocated for public schools and $22.7 billion for colleges, with specific grants to historically Black as well as Tribal and Hispanic-serving universities, the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, Howard University, and Gallaudet University</li>
              <li><b>COVID-19 testing and tracing ($22.4 billion):</b> states will receive stimulus for COVID-19 testing, tracing, and mitigation programs; specific grants will be provided for rural areas and regions of color</li>
              <li><b>COVID-19 vaccines ($32 billion):</b> to fund vaccine distribution, $20 billion will go to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, $9 billion will go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and $3 billion will go to the national stock</li>
              <li><b>Airlines ($18 billion):</b> $15 billion will cover airlines benefits and salaries through March 2021, $1 billion will go to airline contractor payrolls, and $2 billion will go to airports</li>
              <li><b>Banks ($12 billion):</b> the bill will support small lenders and community financial development institutions</li>
              <li><b>Entertainment venues ($15 billion):</b> the bill will provide stimulus for movie theaters, entertainment venues, and cultural institutions</li>
              <li><b>Farms ($12 billion):</b> crop farmers, cattle ranchers and rural communities will receive aid</li>
              <li><b>Rail and transit ($27 billion):</b> $1 billion will go to Amtrak, $14 billion for transit systems, $2 billion will go to the bus industry, and $10 billion for state highways</li>
              <li><b>Small businesses ($325 billion):</b> $284 billion will cover forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans, $20 billion will go toward Economic Injury Disaster Loans</li>
              <li><b>U.S. Postal Service ($10 billion):</b> in exchange for a detailed plan for the allotted funds from USPS, the bill will provide a $10 billion grant</li>
              <li><b>Taxes:</b> the bill will extend tax credit for employers who keep workers on payroll, extend tax breaks for renewable energy, and continue lower taxes on beer and wine</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When Congress sent the newly proposed COVID-19 federal stimulus bill to President Trump, expecting him to sign it into law, he condemned the bill, labeling the bill as having “almost nothing to do with COVID.” He tweeted a video calling for an increase in direct households payments from $600 to $2000, or $4000 for couples. Congress now has two options: pass new legislation that meets the president’s requests or override his veto with a two-thirds majority vote from both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The former would likely delay the overall timeline for federal stimulus, making Americans wait for extended periods of time to receive monetary aid. If President Trump doesn’t sign the bill or get his veto overridden by December 28, there is a possibility of a short government shutdown. If President Trump doesn’t sign or veto the bill by 10 days after the bill is passed, the bill will take effect.</p>
          <p>After President Trump called for officials to increase direct household payments from $600 to $2000 weekly in the newly proposed federal stimulus bill, Democrats attempted to pass higher weekly payments, but Republicans blocked their effort. Republicans then tried to cut foreign aid, but Democrats blocked this pass in turn. President Trumps’ request for higher payments does not align with the Republican lawmakers, many of which are not willing to raise payments higher than the previously agreed upon $600. If President Trump decides to veto the bill, the previous House and Senate votes suggest that there would be enough support to override his veto. However, some Republican officials may be inclined to change their position in light of President Trump’s newly surfaced criticisms.</p>
          <p>The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides federal monetary assistance to self-employed, gig workers, and others that don’t normally qualify for unemployment aid, and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, which provides additional assistance to people who have exhausted regular state unemployment benefits will end on December 26. Unless President Trump approves and signs the $900 billion federal stimulus bill, extra weekly unemployment benefits will not go into effect. Over 22 million jobs were lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic, just over half of which have been recovered as of November 2020. The two aforementioned unemployment benefit programs had provided aid to 14 million of the 20 million unemployment claims filed in the week that ended on December 5. According to the Brookings Institution, nearly 10 million people will lose their unemployment benefits on December 26. State unemployment assistance programs are unharmed, but many have lost eligibility for these programs.</p>
          <p>On December 27, President Trump signed the $900 federal coronavirus stimulus bill into law. Last week, after passing with overwhelming support in Congress, President Trump criticized the bill, stating that some of the fund allocation was unnecessary and should be directed more toward individual households. He requested that lawmakers increase individual stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000 per adult with less than $75,000 in yearly income. The House and Senate are already making preparations to vote on this matter. By signing the bill, President Trump avoided a government shutdown, which could have resulted in devastating consequences. The stimulus bill also includes a $1.4 trillion bill to support government funding through September 2021, which incorporates funding for foreign aid. Now that the stimulus bill is signed into effect, the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program are now set to restart, although officials say that payments will likely be delayed.</p>
