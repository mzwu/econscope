          <p class="lead">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession, the U.S. federal government has taken many measures to provide economic relief. </p>
          <p>On March 27, 2020, the $2.2 trillion economic stimulus bill named the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law, funding numerous lending programs. Congress, the Federal Reserve, the Department of the Treasury, and numerous other government officials have worked to provide as much economic stimulus for the U.S. as possible. Outlined below are nine major stimulus and lending programs created for the ongoing pandemic.</p>
          <p><b>1. Individual stimulus checks</b></p>
          <p>The CARES Act covered the funds for direct stimulus checks for eligible American taxpayers. This Economic Impact Payment (EIP) consisted of up to $1,200 for individuals who earned an adjusted gross income (AGI) of up to $75,000. Additionally, married couples could receive up to $150,000 and families could receive up to $500 per child. The initial launch of deposits took place on April 11, 2020, and physical checks were mailed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by April 24, 2020. These individual stimulus checks were issued starting with those in the lowest income bracket of $10,000 AGI or less, then gradually sending checks to eligible individuals of higher income. Those who receive Social Security retirement benefits, Social Security survivor benefits, Social Security disability benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Railroad Retirement benefits or VA benefits should have received their checks immediately. As of July 23, Congress is considering a second round of stimulus payments.</p>
          <p><b>2. Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)</b></p>
          <p>The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was launched on April 3, 2020, by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Covered by the CARES Act, the PPP supports businesses with under 500 employees by providing loans that fund up to 8 weeks of paycheck costs, benefits, and interest on mortgages, utilities, and rent. Nonprofit organizations, veterans organizations, tribal businesses, independent contractors, sole proprietors, and those who are self-employed are also eligible for the PPP. The PPP terms require banks to fund loans within 10 days of approval, with most applicants receiving their loans within 1-5 days of approval. However, a drawback of the PPP was that it relied on first-come, first-served, which caused many businesses across the nation to be unable to receive a loan. Thus, a second round of PPP loans began processing on April 27, 2020. The two rounds of the PPP yielded 4.9 million loans, the average amount of which was $100,000.</p>
          <p><b>3. Corporate Credit Facilities (PMCCF & SMCCF)</b></p>
          <p>As a result of the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, availability of credit diminished. Therefore, the Federal Reserve launched the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) on March 23, 2020, to support credit to employers. Through the PMCCF, the Federal Reserve created a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to make loans and purchase bonds so that businesses can access credit and remain in operation. Through the SMCCF, the Federal Reserve purchased secondary market corporate bonds of investment grade U.S. companies and exchange-traded funds. By doing so, a portfolio that tracks the market index of U.S. corporate bonds was created. The Treasury used funds allocated from the CARES Act to make an equity investment in the SPV for both facilities.</p>
          <p><b>4. Main Street Lending Program</b></p>
          <p>On April 9, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced the Main Street Lending Program. This program provides up to $600 billion in loans for small to mid-size businesses. In addition, the Treasury will make a $75 billion equity investment from the CARES Act funds. Businesses eligible for the 4-year Main Street loans include those that have less than 10,000 employees or less than $2.5 billion in revenue. Banks will provide 5% of the loan, selling the remaining 95% to the Main Street facility. On April 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it would lower the minimum loan amount to $500,000, expanding the pool of eligible businesses to those with up to 15,000 employees or up to $5 billion in revenue, and adding an extra loan option that would allow lenders to retain a greater share of the loan. On June 8, 2020, the Federal Reserve relaxed the Main Street terms even further, lowering the minimum loan amount to $250,000, increasing the maximum loan amount, increasing the loan period to five years, and extending the repayment period to two years.</p>
          <p><b>5. Municipal Liquidity Facility</b></p>
          <p>The Federal Reserve announced the Municipal Liquidity Facility of April 9, 2020. The facility aids state and local governments in managing cash flow stresses by lending up to $500 billion to states and municipalities. The Treasury used $35 billion from the CARES Act to offer credit protection. On April 27, 2020, the Federal Reserve expanded the eligible population for the Municipal Liquidity Facility to U.S. states including the District of Columbia, U.S. counties with more than 500,000 residents, and U.S. cities with more than 250,000 residents. On June 3, 2020, the Federal Reserve further extended the facility terms such that at least two cities or counties for every U.S. state could issue notes regardless of population.</p>
          <p><b>6. Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)</b></p>
          <p>The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was initially established in March of 2008 to combat the Great Recession, improving the ability of primary dealers to provide financing in securities markets and promoting smooth financial market functioning overall. These primary dealers act as trading counterparties for the Federal Reserveâ€™s open market operations and are crucial in providing liquidity for the U.S. securities market. The PCDF launched on March 20, 2020, allowing primary dealers to support smooth market functioning and supporting the credit needs of businesses and households. The program was set to last a period of six months, but the Federal Reserve announced on July 28, 2020, that it would extend all programs set to expire in September to run until December 31, 2020. </p>
          <p><b>7. Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)</b></p>
          <p>The Federal Reserve launched the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) on March 17, 2020, to facilitate credit flow to businesses and households. Commercial paper markets serve a multitude of purposes ranging from supplying credit for auto loans and mortgages to providing liquidity for the operational needs of various companies. The commercial paper market has been put under strain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so the CPFF aims to facilitate smooth market functioning by eliminating much of the risk in the market and encouraging investors to engage term lending. The facility provides a liquidity backstop through a SPV which will then purchase unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper from eligible companies. By doing so, the CPFF provides credit to households, businesses, and jobs across the nation. The Treasury invested $10 billion of credit protection in the CPFF, which the Federal Reserve will then redirect to finance the SPV.</p>
          <p><b>8. Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF)</b></p>
          <p>The Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) was launched by the Federal Reserve on March 18, 2020, to support credit flow to businesses and households. Because money market funds are common investment tools for companies and families, the MMLF was established to enhance money market functioning and liquidity by assisting market funds in meeting demands for investors. Under the MMLF, eligible financial institutions will purchase high-quality assets from money market mutual funds, which will secure loans provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The Treasury has invested $10 billion from the CARES Act into credit protection for the MMLF.</p>
          <p><b>9. Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF)</b></p>
          <p>The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) was initially announced in November of 2008 to provide stimulus during the Great Recession and was launched again on March 23, 2020. Asset-backed securities can finance various kinds of consumer and business credit, among which are small business loans, student loans, auto loans, and credit card loans. The TALF aims to facilitate credit flow to businesses and households by enabling the issuance of asset-backed securities, loans guaranteed by the SBA, and other assets. On July 23, 2020, the Federal Reserve expanded the TALF to extend its outreach to a wider range of agents and their respective markets. The Treasury made an equity investment, funded by the CARES Act, to fund the SPV for this facility.</p>
