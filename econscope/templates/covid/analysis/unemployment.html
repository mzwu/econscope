          <p class="lead">The rise of COVID-19 resulted in record-breaking consequences regarding unemployment in the U.S. </p>
          <p>From March 14 to March 21, the number of unemployment claims jumped from 282,000 to 3,283,000 — a 1000% increase. The next week, 6,648,000 jobless claims were filed. The March unemployment rate was reported to be 4.4%, a high in the past decade. By April 9, the total number of unemployment claims reached 16.78 million in a matter of three weeks. As of April 16, the number hit 22.03 million. The nation’s unemployment rate peaked in April at 14.7%, faltering throughout the next couple months but still remaining significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Not only are workers being laid off in vast amounts across the country, but the number of available jobs in the U.S. economy as a whole is diminishing. Up until February 2020, the number of monthly job increases had remained steady at roughly 235,000 new available jobs per month. However, 701,000 jobs were taken off the market over the duration of March 2020. This means that not only are people left without jobs, but there is also less space in the job market even if all existing jobs are available to be filled.</p>
          <p>How does COVID-19 relate to unemployment numbers? Starting in mid-March, federal and state governments have taken steps to flatten out the virus infection rate. Such actions include social isolation, school shutdowns, and state lockdowns. Governors have ordered state citizens to stay at home unless for emergencies, grocery store trips, etc. However, not everyone has the option or capability to work from home. In the U.S., 27.3 million people have jobs that are considered “high contact-intensive,” including barbers, airline attendants, food and beverage service, and more. Moreover, 66.8 million workers are in “occupations with high risk of layoff,” working in industries such as leisure, hospitality, education, recreation, and retail. After months of surveying and analysis, studies have shown that the demographic groups that tend to suffer the most economically from this pandemic include those who are Black or Latinx, female, or who belong to the younger population. These workers need to physically travel to certain locations in order to carry out their jobs, but they also need their customers to physically be there to receive and pay for their services. These jobs, businesses, and industries are all being harmed due to a drastic change in consumer behavior as a reaction to the global pandemic. The federal government has responded to this crisis by offering $1200 personal stimulus checks to anyone who makes less than $75,000 annually, in addition to $500 per child. Unemployed workers will also be benefited with lengthened insurance and weekly monetary benefits for a few months. To support businesses, the government has also implemented numerous lending programs to help them stay afloat and pay their workers.</p>
          <p>Let’s compare the current health and economic crisis to crises of the past. The Great Recession of 2008 was caused by the risky lending of subprime mortgages, resulting in major debt and rapidly rising real estate prices. The peak unemployment rate during the Great Recession was 10% and mainly affected male, young, and less educated workers. The Great Depression of the 1930s was due to a culmination of events: reliance on credit, unpaid debt, inability of banks to provide loans, and the stock market crash. During this period, businesses couldn’t sustain themselves and resorted to firing workers, not unlike modern day. The peak unemployment rate of the Great Depression was 24.9%; for the coronavirus, the Federal Reserve predicts a total unemployment count of 47 million, topping the Great Depression at a 32.1% unemployment rate. Even if these predictions are inaccurate, the current unemployment situation has already reached extreme rates; it will take a lot for the U.S. economy to revert back to its original path.</p>
